//! Grafana Utils Rust crate.
//!
//! Maintainers should read the full architecture overview here:
//! <docs/overview-rust.md>
//!
//! Crate shape:
//! - `cli` owns only unified command topology, parsing, and dispatch.
//! - Domain facades (`dashboard`, `alert`, `access`, `datasource`, `sync`, `snapshot`) own
//!   command normalization, client/request wiring, and top-level routing.
//! - Shared infrastructure (`common`, `http`) owns errors, JSON/filesystem
//!   helpers, auth/client setup primitives, and live transport behavior.
//! - Crate-private helper modules below are mostly internal contracts or
//!   subsystem-specific support code; they should not grow into new public
//!   maintainer entrypoints without an explicit docs update.
//!
//! Non-obvious relationships:
//! - `datasource` reuses dashboard auth/client helpers instead of owning a
//!   separate transport/auth stack.
//! - `sync` composes staged document builders with `alert_sync`,
//!   `datasource_provider`, and `datasource_secret` assessments.
//! - Interactive/TUI flows stay inside their owning domains, with shared shell
//!   chrome isolated in `tui_shell` when that feature is enabled.
