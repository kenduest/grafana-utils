# dashboard

## Purpose
`grafana-util dashboard` is the namespace for live dashboard workflows, local draft handling, export/import review, inspection, topology, and screenshots. The same namespace is also available as `grafana-util db`.

## When to use
Use this namespace when you need to browse live dashboards, fetch or clone a live dashboard into a local JSON draft, compare local files with Grafana, inspect export or live metadata, convert raw dashboards into prompt JSON, or publish a prepared dashboard back to Grafana.

## Description
Open this page first when the work is about the full dashboard workflow rather than one isolated flag. The `dashboard` namespace brings together the tasks that usually travel together in real operator work: inventory reads, export and backup, migration between environments, staged review before apply, live inspection, topology checks, and reproducible screenshots.

If you are an SRE, Grafana operator, or responder, this page should help you decide which dashboard path to open next. If you already know the exact action, jump from here into the matching subcommand page for the concrete flags and examples.

## Workflow lanes

- **Browse and inventory**: browse, list, and fetch-live.
- **Analyze dashboards and build reports**: analyze, list-vars, and topology checks.
- **Move**: export, import, clone-live, raw-to-prompt, diff, and publish paths.
- **Author**: fetch-live, clone-live, serve, patch-file, edit-live, review, and publish around one dashboard draft.
- **Review Before Mutate**: review, governance-gate, and impact analysis.
- **History**: list, restore, and export revision history before you recover or promote a dashboard.
- **Capture**: screenshot flows for reproducible visual proof.

For single-dashboard authoring, the local draft path is:
- `fetch-live` or `clone-live` to start from one live dashboard
- `serve` to keep one or more drafts open in a local preview browser while you edit, optionally opening the browser for you
- `review` to verify one draft
- `patch-file` to rewrite local metadata
- `edit-live` to fetch one live dashboard into an editor with a safe local-draft default and a review-aware apply gate
- `publish` to replay that draft back through the import pipeline

`review`, `patch-file`, and `publish` also accept `--input -` for one wrapped or bare dashboard JSON document from standard input. Use that when an external generator already writes the dashboard JSON to stdout. `patch-file --input -` requires `--output`, and `publish --watch` is the local-file variant for repeated save-and-preview loops and does not support `--input -`.

Choose this page when the task is dashboard work but you are still deciding whether the next step is to inspect, move, review, or capture.

## Before / After

- **Before**: dashboard work is often split across UI browsing, one-off exports, local JSON edits, and ad hoc screenshot or review steps.
- **After**: the `dashboard` namespace keeps browse, inspect, move, review, and capture in one place, so you can pick the lane first and then jump to the matching subcommand.

## What success looks like

- you can tell whether the task is inspect, move, review, or capture before opening a subcommand
- inventory reads, export/import flows, and review surfaces share the same auth and bundle conventions
- screenshot and topology paths stay available when you need proof instead of only a final JSON blob

## Failure checks

- if browse output looks incomplete, verify the profile, auth flags, and target org before retrying
- if live inspect or topology output looks stale, confirm you are pointing at the current Grafana and not at an older local export
- if a result is going into automation, set `--output-format` explicitly so the downstream step knows the contract

## Key flags
- `--url`: Grafana base URL.
- `--token`, `--basic-user`, `--basic-password`: shared live Grafana credentials.
- `--profile`: load repo-local defaults from `grafana-util.yaml`.
- `--color`: control JSON color output for the namespace.

## Auth notes
- Prefer `--profile` for repeatable daily work and CI.
- Use direct Basic auth for bootstrap or admin-heavy flows.
- Token auth can be enough for scoped reads, but cross-org workflows such as `--all-orgs` are safer with admin-backed `--profile` or Basic auth.
- `dashboard raw-to-prompt` is usually offline, but it can optionally use `--profile` or live auth flags to look up datasource inventory while repairing prompt files.

## Examples
```bash
# Purpose: Inspect the dashboard namespace before choosing a lane.
grafana-util dashboard --help
```

```bash
# Purpose: Browse live dashboards from a saved profile.
grafana-util dashboard browse --profile prod
```

```bash
# Purpose: Browse a local Grafana instance with explicit credentials.
grafana-util dashboard browse --url http://localhost:3000 --basic-user admin --basic-password admin
```

```bash
# Purpose: Convert a legacy dashboard export into prompt-friendly JSON.
grafana-util dashboard raw-to-prompt --input-file ./legacy/cpu-main.json --profile prod --org-id 2
```

```bash
# Purpose: Review one generated dashboard from standard input before mutation.
jsonnet dashboards/cpu.jsonnet | grafana-util dashboard review --input - --output-format json
```

```bash
# Purpose: Watch one local draft file and rerun publish dry-run after each save.
grafana-util dashboard publish --url http://localhost:3000 --basic-user admin --basic-password admin --input ./drafts/cpu-main.json --dry-run --watch
```

```bash
# Purpose: Open one local dashboard draft in the local preview server.
grafana-util dashboard serve --input ./drafts/cpu-main.json --port 18080 --open-browser
```

```bash
# Purpose: Pull one live dashboard into an external editor and keep the result as a local draft by default.
