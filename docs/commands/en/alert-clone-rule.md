- Override folder, rule group, receiver, or route behavior while cloning.

## Key flags

- `--source` identifies the rule to clone.
- `--name` sets the new rule name.
- `--folder`, `--rule-group`, `--receiver`, and `--no-route` adjust the clone target.
- `--dry-run` previews the cloned output.

## Examples

# Purpose: Clone an existing staged alert rule into a new authoring target.
grafana-util alert clone-rule --desired-dir ./alerts/desired --source cpu-high --name cpu-high-staging --folder staging-alerts --rule-group cpu --receiver slack-platform
grafana-util alert clone-rule --desired-dir ./alerts/desired --source cpu-high --name cpu-high-staging --dry-run
