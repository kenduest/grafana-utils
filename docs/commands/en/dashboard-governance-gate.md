# dashboard governance-gate

## Purpose
Evaluate governance policy directly against live Grafana or a local export tree, with saved analysis artifacts as an advanced reuse path.

## When to use
Use this when you want a policy pass or fail result before promotion. Prefer direct live or local analysis inputs for the common path; keep `governance-json` and `queries-json` for advanced reuse and CI pipelines.

## Before / After

- **Before**: teams can export dashboards and inspect them, but policy violations still need a human to spot them one by one.
- **After**: governance-gate turns those artifacts into an explicit pass/fail decision with machine-readable findings for CI or review.

## Key flags
- `--policy-source`: choose `file` or `builtin`.
- `--policy`: policy file path when using file-based policy input.
- `--builtin-policy`: named built-in policy when using builtin policy input.
- `--url`: analyze live Grafana directly.
- `--import-dir`: analyze a local export tree directly.
- `--input-format`: choose `raw` or `provisioning` when analyzing local exports.
- `--governance`: path to dashboard inspect governance JSON (`governance-json` artifact, advanced reuse).
- `--queries`: path to dashboard inspect query-report JSON (`queries-json` artifact, advanced reuse).
- `--output-format`: render text or JSON.
- `--json-output`: optionally write the normalized result JSON.
- `--interactive`: open the interactive terminal browser over findings.

## Examples
```bash
# Purpose: Evaluate governance policy against live Grafana directly.
grafana-util dashboard governance-gate --url http://localhost:3000 --basic-user admin --basic-password admin --policy-source file --policy ./policy.yaml
```

```bash
# Purpose: Evaluate governance policy against a local export tree directly.
grafana-util dashboard governance-gate --import-dir ./dashboards/raw --input-format raw --policy-source builtin --builtin-policy default --output-format json --json-output ./governance-check.json
```

```bash
# Purpose: Advanced reuse: evaluate governance policy against reusable analysis artifacts.
grafana-util dashboard governance-gate --policy-source builtin --builtin-policy default --governance ./governance.json --queries ./queries.json --output-format json --json-output ./governance-check.json
```

## What success looks like

- policy checks fail before promotion, not after a dashboard lands in the wrong environment
- text output is readable enough for manual review, while JSON output is stable enough for CI gates
- the same artifacts can be rechecked after a policy change without rerunning export or inspect from scratch

## Failure checks

- if the command fails immediately, confirm the policy source and whether the policy file path or builtin policy name is valid
- if the gate result seems incomplete, verify that `governance` and `queries` came from the same inspect run
- if automation reads the result, prefer `--output-format json` and validate the contract before treating a pass/fail as final
