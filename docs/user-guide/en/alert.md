# Alert Operator Handbook

This guide is for operators who need to author alerting changes locally, review the delta before applying it, or replay legacy alert bundles without guessing at the live effect.

This guide covers `grafana-util alert` as an operator workflow for alert desired-state authoring, review-first mutation, and migration-style replay flows.

## Who It Is For

- Operators maintaining Grafana Alerting rules, routes, contact points, and templates.
- Reviewers who need to understand an alert bundle before apply.
- Teams moving alerting state through Git, review, or CI workflows.

## Primary Goals

- Build or import alert desired state without touching live Grafana first.
- Review plan output before an apply path.
- Use replay and migration flows without guessing what live resources will change.

> **Operator Principle**: Change alerts deliberately through a **Plan -> Review -> Apply** cycle to prevent accidental mutations in live environments.

## 🛠️ What This Area Is For

Use the alert area when the work is about Grafana alerting resources:
- **Desired State**: Build new alert configurations locally without touching live Grafana.
- **Review delta**: Compare your desired state against the live estate before approving changes.
- **Controlled Apply**: Execute only reviewed plans.
- **Migration & Replay**: Use the legacy `raw/` lane for inventory snapshots and environment-wide moves.

---

## 🚧 Workflow Boundaries (Two Lanes)

Alerting is split into two distinct operational lanes. **Do not mix these lanes.**

| Lane | Purpose | Common Commands |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authoring Lane** | Desired-state files for review/apply. | `init`, `add-rule`, `add-contact-point`, `plan`, `apply` |
| **Migration Lane** | Inventory snapshots and raw replay. | `export`, `import`, `diff`, `list-rules` |

---

## 📋 Authoring Desired State

Start by scaffolding a desired-state tree. This creates local files that represent your "intent".

```bash
# Initialize a desired-state tree
grafana-util alert init --desired-dir ./alerts/desired

# Add a rule to your local files (does not touch Grafana yet)
grafana-util alert add-rule \
  --desired-dir ./alerts/desired \
  --name cpu-high --folder platform-alerts \
  --receiver pagerduty-primary --threshold 80 --above --for 5m
```

---

## 🔬 Review and Apply (The Review Cycle)

Use `plan` to build a preview of the delta between your local files and live Grafana.

```bash
# Generate a plan for review
grafana-util alert plan \
  --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --basic-user admin --basic-password admin \
  --desired-dir ./alerts/desired --prune --output json
```

**How to Read the Plan Output:**
- **create**: Desired resource is missing in live Grafana.
- **update**: Live Grafana differs from your desired file.
- **delete**: Triggered by `--prune` when a live resource is not in your files.

**Validated Apply Step:**
Only execute after the plan has been reviewed and saved.
```bash
# Purpose: Only execute after the plan has been reviewed and saved.
grafana-util alert apply \
  --plan-file ./alert-plan-reviewed.json \
  --approve --output json
```

## 🔬 Validated Docker Examples

### 1. Alert Plan Excerpt
```bash
# Purpose: 1. Alert Plan Excerpt.
grafana-util alert plan --desired-dir ./alerts/desired --prune --output json
```
**Output Excerpt:**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "create": 1,
    "update": 2,
    "delete": 1,
    "noop": 0,
    "blocked": 0
  }
}
```

### 2. Route Preview
Verify your routing logic locally before applying.
```bash
# Purpose: Verify your routing logic locally before applying.
grafana-util alert preview-route --desired-dir ./alerts/desired --label team=platform --severity critical
```
**Output Excerpt:**
```json
{
  "input": { "labels": { "team": "platform" }, "severity": "critical" },
  "matches": []
}
```
*Note: A blank match list means the contract was evaluated successfully, not necessarily that a live alert exists.*
