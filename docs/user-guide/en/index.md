Welcome to the `grafana-util` handbook. Start here if you need a practical operator path from first connection, to repeatable profiles, to day-to-day Grafana maintenance and automation.

This handbook is organized around the way operators actually work: first understand what the tool is for, then get a safe connection working, then move into dashboards, alerts, access, and review workflows.

If you want the high-level framing first, including the pain points this tool is meant to solve and when it is the right fit, start here:

## 30-Second Quick Start

Get from zero to a first install check, connectivity check, and estate-level overview in three commands.

### 1. Install (Global Binary)
```bash
# Downloads and installs the latest version to your local bin directory
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenduest-brobridge/grafana-utils/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Confirm the Installed Version
```bash
# Purpose: 2. Confirm the Installed Version.
grafana-util --version
```

### 3. Run Your First Global Audit
```bash
# Generates a high-level health and inventory report of your Grafana estate
grafana-util overview live --url http://localhost:3000 --basic-user admin --prompt-password --output interactive
```

**Why this matters:** In 30 seconds, you have confirmed connectivity, checked dashboards and alerts, and found the first obvious data source problems before you make changes.

## Navigation Map

### Phase 1: Foundation
*   **[What grafana-util is for](what-is-grafana-util.md)**: Start with the problems it solves and the operator workflows it is meant to support.
*   **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**: Installation, connection setup, profiles, and auth options.
*   **[New User Path](role-new-user.md)**: The shortest safe path from install to first successful live read.
*   **[SRE / Ops Path](role-sre-ops.md)**: The operator path for day-to-day governance, review-first change flows, and troubleshooting.
*   **[Automation / CI Path](role-automation-ci.md)**: The profile, output, and command-reference path for scripting and automation.
*   **[Architecture & Design Principles](architecture.md)**: The reasoning behind the workflow and command design.

### Phase 2: Core Asset Management
*   **[Dashboard Management](dashboard.md)**: Export, import, inspection, screenshots, and governance checks for dashboard assets.
*   **[Data source Management](datasource.md)**: Export, import, inspection, and live mutation guidance for Grafana data sources.
*   **[Alerting Governance](alert.md)**: Review, planning, and apply flow for Grafana alerts.

### Phase 3: Identity & Access

## Choose Your Role

Different readers usually need different paths through the handbook:

*   **New user**
  Start with [What grafana-util is for](what-is-grafana-util.md), then [New User Path](role-new-user.md), then [Getting Started](getting-started.md), then open [Command Docs](../../commands/en/index.md) when you need exact flags.
*   **SRE / operator**
  Start with [SRE / Ops Path](role-sre-ops.md), then [Change & Status](change-overview-status.md), [Dashboard Management](dashboard.md), [Data source Management](datasource.md), and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
*   **Identity / access administrator**
  Start with [Access Management](access.md), then [Technical Reference](reference.md), then the [Command Docs](../../commands/en/index.md).
*   **Automation / CI owner**
  Start with [Automation / CI Path](role-automation-ci.md), then [Technical Reference](reference.md), then the [Command Docs](../../commands/en/index.md), then validate exact terminal lookup with the top-level manpage at `docs/man/grafana-util.1`.
*   **Maintainer / architect**
  Start with [docs/DEVELOPER.md](/Users/kendlee/work/grafana-utils/docs/DEVELOPER.md), then [maintainer-role-map.md](/Users/kendlee/work/grafana-utils/docs/internal/maintainer-role-map.md), then the internal design and playbook docs under [docs/internal/README.md](/Users/kendlee/work/grafana-utils/docs/internal/README.md).
