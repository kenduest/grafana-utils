# Dashboard Operator Handbook

This guide is for operators who need to inventory dashboards, export or import them safely, inspect dependencies, capture screenshots, or review drift before a live change.

## Who It Is For

- SREs and platform engineers responsible for dashboard inventory, promotion, or review.
- Operators who need screenshots, dependency checks, or export trees before a change.
- Teams that want dashboard work to fit into Git, review, and CI flows.

## Primary Goals

- Start from live visibility instead of guessing what exists.
- Understand the export and inspect lanes before replaying files.
- Review drift and dependency shape before import, publish, or delete.

> **Operator-First Design**: This tool treats dashboards as version-controlled assets. The goal is to move and govern dashboard state safely, with enough visibility to decide whether a file is ready to replay, patch, or promote.

## 🛠️ What This Area Is For

Use the dashboard area for estate-level governance:
- **Inventory**: Understand what exists across one or many organizations.
- **Structured Export**: Move dashboards between environments with dedicated "lanes".
- **Deep Inspection**: Analyze queries and datasource dependencies offline.
- **Screenshots and visual checks**: Produce reproducible dashboard or panel captures for docs, incident notes, and debugging.
- **Drift Review**: Compare staged files against live Grafana before applying.
- **Controlled Mutation**: Import or delete dashboards with mandatory dry-runs.

---

## 🔎 Inspection and screenshot workflows

If your goal is not export or import, but understanding what a dashboard currently looks like, which dependencies it carries, and how variables resolve, start here.

- `dashboard inspect-live`: inspect one live dashboard's structure, queries, and dependencies.
- `dashboard inspect-export`: inspect an exported dashboard file offline.
- `dashboard inspect-vars`: verify variables, datasource choices, and URL-scoped inputs.
- `dashboard screenshot`: generate a reproducible dashboard or panel capture with a headless browser.
- `dashboard topology`: trace the dashboard's upstream relationships at a glance.

Common cases:

- attaching a screenshot to an incident or runbook
- checking whether one panel resolves the intended variables and datasources
- producing docs or review captures without manual screenshots
- reviewing query/dependency structure before making changes

## 🚧 Workflow Boundaries (The Three Lanes)

Dashboard export intentionally produces three different "lanes" because each serves a different operator workflow. **These lanes are not interchangeable.**

| Lane | Purpose | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `raw/` | **Canonical Replay** | The primary source for `grafana-util dashboard import`. Reversible and API-friendly. |
| `prompt/` | **UI Import** | Compatible with the Grafana UI "Upload JSON" feature. If you only have ordinary or raw dashboard JSON, convert it first with `grafana-util dashboard raw-to-prompt`. |
| `provisioning/` | **File Provisioning** | When Grafana should read dashboards from disk via its internal provisioning system. |

---

## 🔤 Prompt Placeholder Notes

- `$datasource` is a dashboard variable reference.
- `${DS_*}` is an external-import placeholder created from `__inputs`.
- A prompt dashboard can legitimately contain both forms at once.
- That usually means the dashboard keeps a Grafana datasource-variable workflow while also needing external-import inputs.
- Do not assume `$datasource` automatically means mixed datasource families. In many cases it only means the dashboard is still routing panel selection through one datasource variable.

---

## ⚖️ Staged vs Live: The Operator Logic

- **Staged Work**: Local export trees, validation, offline inspection, and dry-run reviews.
- **Live Work**: Grafana-backed inventory, live diffs, imports, and deletions.

**The Golden Rule**: Start with `list` or `browse` to discover, `export` to a staged tree, `inspect` and `diff` to verify, and only then `import` or `delete` after a matching dry-run.

## 📋 Reading Live Inventory

Use `dashboard list` to get a fast picture of the estate.

```bash
# Purpose: Use dashboard list to get a fast picture of the estate.
grafana-util dashboard list \
  --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --basic-user admin \
  --basic-password admin \
  --table
```

**Validated Output Excerpt:**
```text
UID                      NAME                                      FOLDER  FOLDER_UID      FOLDER_PATH  ORG        ORG_ID
-----------------------  ----------------------------------------  ------  --------------  -----------  ---------  ------
rYdddlPWl                Node Exporter Full for Host               Demo    ffhrmit0usjk0b  Demo         Main Org.  1
spring-jmx-node-unified  Spring JMX + Node Unified Dashboard (VM)  Demo    ffhrmit0usjk0b  Demo         Main Org.  1
```

**How to Read It:**
- **UID**: Stable identity for automation and deletion.
- **FOLDER_PATH**: Where the dashboard is organized.
- **ORG/ORG_ID**: Confirms which organization owns the object.

## 🔬 Validated Docker Examples

### 1. Export Progress
Use `--progress` for a clean log during large estate exports.
```bash
# Purpose: Use --progress for a clean log during large estate exports.
grafana-util dashboard export --export-dir ./dashboards --overwrite --progress
```
**Output Excerpt:**
```text
Exporting dashboard 1/7: mixed-query-smoke
Exporting dashboard 2/7: smoke-prom-only
...
Exporting dashboard 7/7: two-prom-query-smoke
```

### 2. Dry-Run Import Preview
Always confirm the destination action before mutation.
```bash
# Purpose: Always confirm the destination action before mutation.
grafana-util dashboard import --import-dir ./dashboards/raw --dry-run --table
```
**Output Excerpt:**
```text
UID                    DESTINATION  ACTION  FOLDER_PATH                    FILE
---------------------  -----------  ------  -----------------------------  --------------------------------------
mixed-query-smoke      exists       update  General                        ./dashboards/raw/Mixed_Query_Dashboard.json
subfolder-chain-smoke  missing      create  Platform / Team / Apps / Prod  ./dashboards/raw/Subfolder_Chain.json
```
- **ACTION=create**: New dashboard will be added.
- **ACTION=update**: Existing live dashboard will be replaced.
- **DESTINATION=missing**: No live dashboard currently owns that UID, so the import would create a new record.
- **DESTINATION=exists**: The UID already exists in Grafana, so the import would target that live dashboard.

### 3. Provisioning-Oriented Comparison
Compare your local provisioning files against live state.
```bash
# Purpose: Compare your local provisioning files against live state.
grafana-util dashboard diff --import-dir ./dashboards/provisioning --input-format provisioning
```
**Output Excerpt:**
```text
--- live/cpu-main
+++ export/cpu-main
-  "title": "CPU Overview"
+  "title": "CPU Overview v2"
```
