# Developer Notes

This document is for maintainers. Keep `README.md` GitHub-facing and task-oriented; put implementation detail, internal tradeoffs, and maintenance notes here.

Commit message default for this repo:

- first line: short imperative title
- blank line
- then 2-4 flat `- ...` detail bullets
- keep the bullets concrete about code, tests, docs, or migration impact

## Documentation Maintenance Contract

- Keep `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md` command documentation sections split by domain: Dashboard, Datasource, Alert, and Access/User so operators can jump directly to one surface without scanning unrelated flags.
- Keep the English and Traditional Chinese user guides (`docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`) in lockstep on command surface naming and domain grouping.
- When command behavior or parameter shapes change, update:
  - top-level README quick map and per-domain command lists
  - both language versions of the README documentation sections
  - both full user guides, including parameter purpose / mode / scenario notes where affected
- Treat deprecated/legacy option text as cleanup debt: replace `--table/--csv/--json` and other legacy aliases with `--output-format` guidance where implementation supports it, and remove stale "old options" notes from README/examples.
- For PR-ready changes, include a brief mention in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` whenever docs structure is updated so future contributors know whether behavior, parser compatibility, or only docs shape changed.

- `scripts/set-version.sh`: shared maintainer helper that keeps `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and the root package entry in `rust/Cargo.lock` aligned for release bumps and optional preview bumps

## Version Workflow

- `VERSION` is the checked-in maintainer version source used by `scripts/set-version.sh`.
- Use `make print-version` to inspect the current `VERSION`, Python package version, Rust crate version, and Rust lockfile package version together.
- Use `make sync-version` after editing `VERSION` manually to push that version into `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.lock`.
- Prefer keeping `dev` and `main` on the same plain checked-in version between releases so normal merges do not conflict on version lines by default.
- Use `make set-release-version VERSION=X.Y.Z` when preparing `main` for a formal release version and the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- Use `make set-dev-version VERSION=X.Y.Z DEV_ITERATION=N` only when you intentionally need branch-specific preview artifacts such as `X.Y.Z.devN` / `X.Y.Z-dev.N`.
- Preferred release ritual:
  - keep day-to-day work on `dev`
  - switch to `main`
  - run `make set-release-version VERSION=X.Y.Z`
  - merge `dev` into `main`
  - keep the plain release values in `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.lock` if a version conflict still appears
  - run `make test`
  - create tag `vX.Y.Z`
- If `dev` is not carrying a preview-only version, there is no required post-release `.dev1` bump.

### Python CLI Boundaries

- `grafana_utils.unified_cli` only dispatches and normalizes top-level command entrypoints; it does not implement domain business logic.
- `grafana_utils.dashboard_cli`, `grafana_utils.alert_cli`, `grafana_utils.access_cli`, and `grafana_utils.datasource_cli` are stable facades: parser wiring, output-mode normalization, auth/client bootstrap, and dispatch stay here, while heavier execution remains in dedicated workflow/parser modules.
- [Python overview for maintainers](docs/overview-python.md) provides a longer architecture walkthrough.
- [Rust overview for maintainers](docs/overview-rust.md) provides a longer architecture walkthrough.
- Rust `sync bundle` now produces a portable source-bundle document that carries dashboards, folders, datasource inventory, top-level normalized alert-rule sync specs, raw `alerting` sections, and bundle metadata. The main remaining alert-side gap is whether additional alerting artifact types such as contact points, mute timings, policies, and templates should also gain safe top-level sync/preflight representations.

## Python Baseline

- Both Python entrypoints now target Python 3.9+ syntax and runtime support.
- Python 3.9+ is the repo baseline, not only packaging metadata. Do not preserve Python 3.6 or RHEL 8 parser compatibility in new changes.
- Prefer Python 3.9 built-in generics such as `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, and `tuple[str, ...]` in touched code.
- Avoid Python 3.10 union syntax such as `str | None`.
- Keep using `typing.Optional`, `typing.Any`, `typing.Iterable`, and similar helpers where Python 3.9 still needs them.

## Dashboard Utility

### CLI shape

- Mode selection is explicit.
- Installed Python console script is `grafana-util`.
- Alert workflows no longer ship a separate `grafana-alert-utils` entrypoint; use `grafana-util alert ...`.
- `grafana-util` is now the primary entrypoint for dashboard, datasource, alert, and access workflows.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard list ...` to inspect live dashboard summaries.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils datasource list ...` as the preferred live Grafana datasource inventory CLI.
- Keep `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard list-data-sources ...` only as a compatibility path while older automation migrates.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard inspect-live ...` to inspect live Grafana dashboards through the same summary/report renderers used for raw exports.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard export ...` for export.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard import ...` for import.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils dashboard diff ...` for live-vs-local comparison.
- Use `python3 -m grafana_utils access ...` or `cargo run --bin grafana-util -- access ...` for Grafana access-management workflows.
- `grafana-util access user list ...` inspects Grafana users.
- `grafana-util access user add ...` creates Grafana users through the server-admin API.
- `grafana-util access user modify ...` updates Grafana users through the global and admin user APIs.
- `grafana-util access user delete ...` removes Grafana users from the org or globally with explicit confirmation.
- `grafana-util access team list ...` inspects Grafana teams.
- `grafana-util access team add ...` creates an org-scoped Grafana team with optional initial members and admins.
- `grafana-util access team modify ...` changes Grafana team membership and admin assignments.
- `grafana-util access team delete ...` deletes one Grafana team with explicit confirmation.
- `grafana-util access group ...` is a compatibility alias for the `team` command surface.
- `grafana-util access service-account ...` handles org-scoped service-account operations.
- The export subcommand intentionally uses `--export-dir` instead of `--output-dir` to avoid mixing export terminology with import behavior.
- Dashboard `--token` auth should be treated as already scoped to one current org context. It is valid for current-org list/export/import operations, but it is not the mechanism for explicit org switching.
- `export-dashboard --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the dashboard client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` and is Basic-auth-only because org switching is a server-admin-style workflow rather than a token-bound current-org workflow.
- `export-dashboard --all-orgs` lists `/api/orgs`, rebuilds one scoped export client per org, and exports each org into an `org_<id>_<name>/` subtree to avoid cross-org file collisions on disk.
- `import-dashboard --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the dashboard client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` for the whole import run and is Basic-auth-only because explicit org switching remains a server-admin-style workflow rather than a token-bound current-org workflow.
- Multi-org export still writes aggregate root-level `raw/index.json` and `prompt/index.json` files under the chosen export root so the top-level manifest points at one coherent variant index.
- Top-level dashboard help and `export-dashboard -h` now include both a local Basic-auth example and a token example so operators can see both auth styles directly from the CLI.
- The `list-dashboard` subcommand is read-only and now defaults to table output with `UID`, `NAME`, `FOLDER`, `FOLDER_UID`, `FOLDER_PATH`, `ORG`, and `ORG_ID` columns.
- `list-dashboard --no-header` keeps the table rows but suppresses the header line for shell pipelines or snapshot-style output.
- `list-dashboard --csv` emits header `uid,name,folder,folderUid,path,org,orgId` with CSV escaping.
- `list-dashboard --json` emits an array of objects with keys `uid`, `name`, `folder`, `folderUid`, `path`, `org`, `orgId`, `sources`, and `sourceUids`.
- `list-dashboard` fetches the current org from `GET /api/org` once and attaches that `org` and `orgId` metadata to every listed dashboard summary.
- `list-dashboard --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` and is Basic-auth-only because the CLI needs a server-admin-style org switch rather than a token-bound current org context.
- `list-dashboard --all-orgs` lists `/api/orgs`, rebuilds one scoped client per org, and aggregates the combined dashboard list output. This is also Basic-auth-only.
- `list-dashboard --json` now fetches each dashboard payload plus the datasource catalog by default so machine-readable output includes `sources` and `sourceUids` without an extra flag.
- `list-dashboard --with-sources` still controls datasource expansion for table and CSV output, because those compact human-readable formats would otherwise become wider and slower by default.
- `list-dashboard --with-sources --csv` appends both `sources` and `sourceUids` so spreadsheet or script consumers can correlate dashboards back to concrete datasource UIDs when Grafana exposed them.
- `export-dashboard` and `import-dashboard` stay quiet by default except for summary output and explicit warnings/errors.
- `export-dashboard --progress` and `import-dashboard --progress` turn on concise per-dashboard `current/total` progress lines.
- `export-dashboard -v` and `import-dashboard -v` turn on detailed per-item output and intentionally suppress the concise `--progress` form when both flags are present.
- Folder tree path is resolved from `GET /api/folders/{uid}` using the folder `parents[]` chain when `folderUid` is present.
- `list-data-sources` is read-only and now defaults to a table with `UID`, `NAME`, `TYPE`, `URL`, and `IS_DEFAULT`.
- `list-data-sources --no-header` suppresses the table header line while keeping the same column layout.
- `list-data-sources --csv` emits header `uid,name,type,url,isDefault`.
- `list-data-sources --json` emits an array of objects with keys `uid`, `name`, `type`, `url`, and `isDefault`.
- `datasource list` is the preferred datasource inventory surface and mirrors the same human/CSV/JSON output contract as the older `dashboard list-data-sources` compatibility path.
- `datasource list --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the datasource client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` and is Basic-auth-only because explicit org listing is a server-admin-style workflow rather than a token-bound current-org workflow.
- `datasource list --all-orgs` lists `/api/orgs`, rebuilds one scoped client per org, aggregates the combined datasource output, and adds `org` / `orgId` fields or columns when the results span explicit org scope. This is also Basic-auth-only.
- `alert list-* --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the alert client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` and is Basic-auth-only because explicit org listing is a server-admin-style workflow rather than a token-bound current-org workflow.
- `alert list-* --all-orgs` lists `/api/orgs`, rebuilds one scoped alert client per org, aggregates the combined alert inventory output, and adds `org` / `orgId` fields or columns when the results span explicit org scope. This is also Basic-auth-only.
- `datasource export` writes one normalized datasource inventory rooted at `datasources.json`, `index.json`, and `export-metadata.json`, and each exported record carries `uid`, `name`, `type`, `access`, `url`, `isDefault`, `org`, and `orgId`.
- `datasource export --org-id <ID>` rebuilds the datasource client with `X-Grafana-Org-Id` and is Basic-auth-only because explicit org export is a server-admin-style workflow rather than a token-bound current-org workflow.
- `datasource export --all-orgs` lists `/api/orgs`, rebuilds one scoped export client per org, writes each org into an `org_<id>_<name>/` subtree, and also writes one aggregate root `index.json` / `export-metadata.json` without a top-level `datasources.json`.
- `datasource import` replays that normalized datasource export root back into Grafana, supports `create-only`, `create-or-update`, and `update-or-skip-missing` modes, and resolves live matches by `uid` first and otherwise by exact datasource `name`.
- `datasource import --org-id` switches the whole datasource import run into one explicit destination org and requires Basic auth, while token-based import stays scoped to the token's current org.
- `datasource import --use-export-org` routes one combined `datasource export --all-orgs` root back into Grafana by each exported `orgId`, is Basic-auth-only, and treats `--org-id` plus `--require-matching-export-org` as incompatible single-org flags.
- `datasource import --only-org-id <ID>` is repeatable and only applies in `--use-export-org` mode, filtering the routed import run down to selected source export org IDs.
- `datasource import --create-missing-orgs` only applies in `--use-export-org` mode; live import creates a missing destination org from the stable exported org name before replay, while dry-run reports `missing-org` or `would-create-org` at the org-preview layer without mutating Grafana.
- `datasource import --require-matching-export-org` compares the export root's recorded `orgId` from `datasources.json` / `index.json` against the resolved target org and fails closed when they differ or when one stable source org cannot be proven.
- Datasource import/diff V1 deliberately accept only the normalized inventory contract (`uid`, `name`, `type`, `access`, `url`, `isDefault`, `org`, `orgId`) and now fail closed when `datasources.json` carries extra fields such as `id`, `jsonData`, `secureJsonData`, or passwords.
- Datasource update safety now also blocks `--replace-existing` name-only matches when the exported datasource `uid` and the live datasource `uid` differ, so imports do not silently retarget one datasource identity onto another just because the names match.
- The Rust alert implementation is intentionally split by responsibility: `alert_cli_defs.rs` owns clap/auth normalization, `alert_client.rs` owns the Grafana alert provisioning client plus shared response parsing helpers, `alert_list.rs` owns list rendering and list-command dispatch, and `alert.rs` keeps the remaining import/export/diff orchestration plus shared alert document helpers.
- The Python dashboard implementation is intentionally split by responsibility: `dashboard_cli.py` stays as the stable CLI facade focused on parser, auth/client wiring, dependency bundles, and top-level dispatch; `grafana_utils/dashboards/output_support.py` owns export pathing, file writes, and export metadata/index builders; `grafana_utils/dashboards/progress.py` owns export/import progress renderers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/folder_support.py` owns folder inventory and import-folder helpers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py` owns import payload, diff, and dry-run helper logic; `grafana_utils/dashboards/listing.py` owns live dashboard/datasource listing plus datasource/source-enrichment helpers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py` owns raw-export discovery plus inventory/manifest validation helpers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_summary.py` owns the inspection summary document plus summary/table renderers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py` owns the explicit per-query report model plus flat/grouped renderers; `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_dependency_models.py` owns the normalized dependency-contract builder layered on top of filtered query rows plus datasource inventory; `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_dispatch.py` owns inspect output-mode validation plus report/summary rendering dispatch; and `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, and `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py` own the high-level orchestration bodies for export, inspect-live/inspect-export, and import respectively.
- The Rust dashboard implementation follows the same boundary at a crate-module level: `dashboard/mod.rs` stays as the public facade and top-level entrypoint/re-export surface; `dashboard/models.rs` owns export/index/inventory payload structs; `dashboard/files.rs` owns raw-export discovery plus inventory/manifest validation helpers; `dashboard/inspect_report.rs` owns the query-report contract and grouped renderers; `dashboard/inspect_summary.rs` owns the inspection summary payload structs; and the import/inspect orchestration stays in the dedicated dashboard submodules.
- The Rust dashboard implementation is intentionally split by responsibility: `dashboard/cli_defs.rs` owns clap/auth/client setup, `dashboard/list.rs` owns list/datasource renderers and org-aware list orchestration, `dashboard/export.rs` owns export pathing and multi-org export orchestration, `dashboard/prompt.rs` owns datasource resolution plus prompt-export template rewrites, and `dashboard/mod.rs` now keeps only the remaining shared constants, CLI entrypoints, and re-exports needed by the dedicated helper modules.
- Rust `dashboard screenshot --full-page` also supports `--full-page-output single|tiles|manifest`. `single` preserves the old stitched image behavior, while `tiles` and `manifest` derive an output directory from the `--output` file stem such as `./cpu-main.png -> ./cpu-main/part-0001.png`; `manifest` adds `manifest.json` with viewport, crop, step, and per-segment offsets. Split output stays raster-only and still requires `--full-page`.
- The Rust access implementation is intentionally split by responsibility: `access/cli_defs.rs` owns clap/auth/client setup, `access/render.rs` owns output formatting and row normalization, `access/user.rs` owns user flows, `access/org.rs` owns org flows, `access/team.rs` owns team flows, `access/service_account.rs` owns service-account flows, and `access/mod.rs` keeps shared request wrappers plus top-level dispatch.
- The Python access implementation follows the same pattern at a smaller scale: `access_cli.py` stays as the stable facade, `grafana_utils/access/parser.py` owns argparse wiring and CLI-shape helpers, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py` owns auth validation plus user/team/service-account orchestration, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py` owns HTTP calls, and `grafana_utils/access/models.py` owns normalization and rendering helpers.
- The Python datasource implementation now follows the same facade pattern: `datasource_cli.py` stays as the stable facade and test-facing helper surface, `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py` owns argparse wiring plus import dry-run column metadata, and `grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py` owns export/import/diff execution plus datasource bundle/file helpers.

### Packaging layout

- The installable Python source now lives under `python/grafana_utils/`.
- Keep one Python parent path in the repo: `python/`. The import namespace remains `grafana_utils.*`.
- `pyproject.toml` exposes `grafana-util` as the Python console script.
- Base installation depends on `requests`.
- Optional extra `.[http2]` adds `httpx[http2]` for Python 3.9+ environments.

### Quality gates

- `make quality` is the baseline local gate and now delegates to `scripts/check-quality.sh`.
- `make quality-python` delegates to `scripts/check-python-quality.sh`, which always runs Python bytecode compilation plus `unittest` and only runs optional tools such as `ruff`, `mypy`, and `black --check` when they are installed.
- `make quality-rust` delegates to `scripts/check-rust-quality.sh`, which always runs `cargo test` and conditionally runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` when those cargo components are available.
- `make quality-alert-rust` is the focused Rust alert gate: it runs alert-specific Rust tests, the sync alert-export artifact regression, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo check`.
- `make quality-sync-rust` is the focused Rust sync gate: it runs sync-specific Rust tests plus the cross-domain source-bundle summary contract, the alert replay artifact preservation/ignore regressions, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo check`.
- `make test-alert-live-artifact` runs only the Rust alert artifact live smoke path against Docker Grafana.
- `make test-alert-live-replay` runs only the Rust alert replay/recreate live smoke path against Docker Grafana.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now calls the same `make quality-python` and `make quality-rust` targets so local and CI quality behavior stays centralized in the scripts instead of being duplicated in workflow YAML.

### Rust cross-build notes

- `make build-rust` now runs the native release build plus the Docker-based Linux `amd64` cross-build and then prints the produced artifact paths.
- `make build-rust-native` runs the local-host release build only and writes binaries under `rust/target/release/`.
- `make build-rust-macos-arm64` runs `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh`.
- That script is the explicit native release path for Apple Silicon Macs and copies binaries into `dist/macos-arm64/`.
- `make build-rust-linux-amd64` runs `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64.sh`.
- The script uses Docker plus the official Rust image to build `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` binaries from macOS.
- `make build-rust-linux-amd64-zig` runs `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64-zig.sh`.
- The zig path expects local `zig`, `cargo-zigbuild`, and a rustup-managed `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target.
- Output is copied into `dist/linux-amd64/` as `grafana-util`.
- This is the preferred Linux `amd64` build path on macOS because it avoids managing a local Linux cross-linker toolchain.

### Export variants

Dashboard export writes two variants by default:

- `raw/`: API-safe dashboard JSON intended for later `import`
- `prompt/`: Grafana web-import JSON with datasource `__inputs`

Current export suppression flags:

- `--without-dashboard-raw`
- `--without-dashboard-prompt`

The two variants serve different consumers and should not be treated as interchangeable.

Dashboard export also writes versioned `export-metadata.json` files at:

- the combined export root
- `raw/`
- `prompt/`

Those manifests use `schemaVersion` and `variant` markers so `import` and `diff` can reject directories that are not the expected raw export layout.

The Python and Rust dashboard CLIs also have `inspect-export` for offline raw-export analysis. The summary path reads the raw `export-metadata.json`, `index.json`, `folders.json`, `datasources.json`, and dashboard files, then summarizes dashboard count, folder paths, panel/query totals, datasource usage, datasource inventory, orphaned datasources, and mixed-datasource dashboards. `inspect-export` accepts either one org-scoped `raw/` directory or one combined dashboard export root produced by `export --all-orgs`; the multi-org path is merged into a temporary inspect raw layout before analysis while report-facing `FILE` and `folderPath` values stay aligned with the original export tree instead of the temporary merge path. `inspect-export --output-format json` emits the same summary as one machine-readable document, while `inspect-export --output-format table` renders the summary as separate summary, folder-path, datasource-usage, datasource-inventory, orphaned-datasource, and mixed-dashboard tables.

`inspect-export` and `inspect-live` use `--output-format` as the primary explicit output selector. `text`, `table`, and `json` cover summary modes, while `report-table`, `report-csv`, `report-json`, `report-tree`, `report-tree-table`, `dependency`, `dependency-json`, `report-dependency`, `report-dependency-json`, `governance`, and `governance-json` cover the corresponding report/governance/dependency-contract modes. Legacy `--json`, `--table`, and `--report` spellings still exist for compatibility, but help and examples should prefer `--output-format`.

The Python CLI also has `inspect-live`, which accepts the normal live dashboard auth/common args, materializes a temporary raw-export-like directory from live dashboard payloads plus current folder and datasource inventories, and then reuses the same summary/report inspection pipeline as `inspect-export`. This keeps the operator-facing output contract aligned while avoiding a second inspection implementation.

Rust `inspect-live --all-orgs` now follows the same broad pattern by exporting each org into a temporary multi-org raw layout, merging the per-org folder and datasource inventories into one temporary inspect root, and then handing that combined root to the existing inspect-export analysis path.

The Rust unified CLI now exposes `--help-full` at the root and at the top-level domain roots `alert`, `datasource`, `access`, and `sync`, so commands such as `grafana-util --help-full` and `grafana-util datasource --help-full` print the normal help followed by extra focused examples. `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` additionally expose subcommand-level `--help-full` on both the Python and Rust CLIs. Normal `-h/--help` stays concise, while `--help-full` prints the same base help followed by extra focused examples.

`inspect-export --output-format report-table` takes the same raw export input but emits one per-query record instead of the higher-level summary. Each record carries dashboard uid/title, folder path, panel id/title/type, target `refId`, resolved datasource label, a best-effort `datasourceUid`, datasource-inventory scope/config fields such as `datasourceOrg`, `datasourceOrgId`, `datasourceDatabase`, `datasourceBucket`, and `datasourceIndexPattern` when available, the query field chosen from the target payload (`expr`, `query`, `rawSql`, and similar), the raw query text, and heuristic extraction fields such as `metrics`, `functions`, `measurements`, and `buckets`. `--output-format report-json` emits the same flat record model as JSON for downstream analysis, `report-tree` / `report-tree-table` render the same underlying records in grouped forms with clearer operator intent, and `report-dependency` / `report-dependency-json` emit the maintained dashboard dependency contract built from those query rows plus datasource inventory. Rust now carries that dependency contract in dedicated modules and re-exports it through the crate surface so bundle/governance tooling can share the same reference model.

`--report-columns` affects `report-table`/`report-csv` output and the grouped `report-tree-table` output, and uses stable column ids such as `dashboard_uid`, `panel_title`, `datasource`, `metrics`, `functions`, `query`, `datasource_org`, `datasource_database`, `datasource_bucket`, and `datasource_index_pattern`. Optional columns such as `datasource_uid` stay out of the default table/CSV layout so the common report shape remains stable, but callers can opt them in explicitly. The validation contract is stricter than it used to be: `--report-columns` is only accepted for flat or grouped table-like report modes and is rejected for summary JSON, dependency contracts, and governance output. `--report-filter-datasource` applies before flat or grouped rendering and now matches datasource label, datasource uid, datasource type, or normalized datasource family. `--report-filter-panel-id` applies at the same stage, is report-only, and keeps only rows whose `panelId` exactly matches the requested value, which is useful when one dashboard expands into many panel/query rows.

### Raw export intent

- Keep dashboard JSON close to Grafana's API payload.
- Preserve `uid`.
- Clear numeric `id`.
- Keep datasource references unchanged.
- Best input for `python3 -m grafana_utils import-dashboard`.

### Prompt export intent

- Transform datasource references into Grafana web-import placeholders.
- Populate `__inputs`, `__requires`, and `__elements` in the shape Grafana expects.
- Intended for Grafana UI import, not for API re-import.

### Prompt export datasource pipeline

The prompt export rewrite flow is intentionally multi-stage:

1. Fetch datasource catalog from Grafana.
2. Index datasources by both `uid` and `name`.
3. Walk the dashboard tree and collect every `datasource` reference.
4. Normalize each datasource reference into a stable key.
5. Build one generated input mapping per unique datasource reference.
6. Rewrite matching dashboard refs to `${DS_*}` placeholders.
7. If every datasource resolves to the same plugin type, add Grafana's shared `$datasource` variable and collapse panel-level refs to it.

This is why prompt export needs live datasource metadata while raw export does not.

### Dashboard import constraints

- Import expects raw dashboard JSON, not prompt JSON.
- Files containing `__inputs` should be imported through Grafana web UI.
- Import can override folder destination with `--import-folder-uid`.
- Raw export writes `raw/folders.json` plus `raw/export-metadata.json::foldersFile` so later imports can reconstruct folder `uid`, `title`, `parentUid`, `path`, `org`, and `orgId` inventory.
- Raw export also writes `raw/datasources.json` plus `raw/export-metadata.json::datasourcesFile` so offline inspection can reconcile datasource `uid`, `name`, `type`, `access`, `url`, `isDefault`, `org`, and `orgId` inventory against dashboard usage.
- Import `--ensure-folders` reads that raw folder inventory, creates missing parent folders through Grafana's folder API, and rejects the run when the inventory manifest is missing.
- Import `--dry-run --ensure-folders` inspects the destination folder inventory first and reports missing versus mismatched exported folders so operators can catch path or parent drift before running a real import.
- Import can set the dashboard version-history message with `--import-message`.
- Import `--dry-run` predicts `would-create`, `would-update`, or `would-fail-existing` by checking the live Grafana UID first.
- Import `--dry-run --table` renders those predictions as `UID`, `DESTINATION`, `ACTION`, `FOLDER_PATH`, and `FILE`, and `--no-header` can suppress the header row only in that mode.
- Import `--dry-run --json` renders one JSON document with `mode`, `folders`, `dashboards`, and `summary`, and suppresses the normal human-readable progress/summary lines so scripts can parse it safely.
- Import `--org-id <ID>` switches the whole run to one explicit destination Grafana org, reusing the same Basic-auth-only org scoping model as `list` and `export`.
- Import `--org-id` intentionally does not read the raw export's recorded `orgId` for routing; it is a manual explicit-target override for the whole run.
- Plain token-auth import remains supported, but only in the token's current org context and without any explicit org switch semantics.
- Import `--require-matching-export-org` is an opt-in safety guard that compares the raw export's recorded `orgId` against the resolved target org for this run before dry-run or live import work starts.
- The target org for `--require-matching-export-org` is `--org-id` when explicitly set, otherwise the current org returned by `GET /api/org` for the active token or Basic-auth client.
- `--require-matching-export-org` reads export org metadata from `index.json`, `folders.json`, and `datasources.json`, and it fails closed when those files do not provide one stable source `orgId`.
- Import `--update-existing-only` switches the workflow to `update-or-skip-missing` by dashboard `uid`, implies overwrite-on-existing behavior, and never creates missing dashboards.
- When import updates an existing dashboard by `uid`, it preserves the destination Grafana folder by default; only an explicit `--import-folder-uid` overrides that folder placement.
- Import `--require-matching-folder-path` adds an update-only guard that compares the raw source folder path with the current destination Grafana folder path and skips existing-dashboard updates when those full paths differ.
- Import `--require-matching-folder-path` does not block creates for missing dashboards, but it is intentionally rejected with `--import-folder-uid` because one flag validates current destination placement while the other forces a new destination.
- Import `--dry-run --table` and `--dry-run --json` now include source and destination folder-path details when the matching-folder-path guard is active so operators can see exactly why a dashboard would be skipped as `skip-folder-mismatch`.
- `inspect-export` is a local raw-export analysis workflow; it does not call Grafana APIs and instead reads `raw/export-metadata.json`, `raw/folders.json`, `raw/datasources.json`, and dashboard JSON files to summarize folder paths, panels, queries, datasource references, datasource inventory, orphaned datasources, and mixed-datasource dashboards.
- `inspect-live` is the live-data adapter for the same inspection workflow; it calls the live dashboard, folder, and datasource APIs, writes a temporary raw-style layout, and then hands off to the existing inspection renderers.
- `inspect-export --output-format report-table` walks the same local dashboard JSON but emits one per-target query record so operators can inspect datasource usage plus query text and extracted metric-like names without contacting Grafana.
- Report extraction should stay decomposed by datasource/query family over time. Shared traversal and row rendering can remain generic, but Prometheus, Loki, Flux/Influx, SQL, and future datasource-specific parsing should be pluggable so one datasource's parser growth does not complicate the others.
- `inspect-export --output-format table --no-header` suppresses the header row for each rendered section table when operators need compact terminal output.
- Import now prints an `Import mode: ...` line before processing files so operators can confirm the active create/update/skip strategy immediately.
- `diff` compares normalized local raw payloads against live Grafana dashboard wrappers and prints a unified diff when they differ.

## Alerting Utility

### Supported resource kinds

`grafana-util alert` currently supports:

- alert rules
- contact points
- mute timings
- notification policies
- notification message templates
- preferred command forms:
  - `grafana-util alert export ...`
  - `grafana-util alert import ...`
  - `grafana-util alert diff ...`
  - `grafana-util alert list-rules ...`
  - `grafana-util alert list-contact-points ...`
  - `grafana-util alert list-mute-timings ...`
  - `grafana-util alert list-templates ...`
- legacy direct aliases also exist:
  - `grafana-util export-alert ...`
  - `grafana-util import-alert ...`
  - `grafana-util diff-alert ...`
  - `grafana-util list-alert-rules ...`
  - `grafana-util list-alert-contact-points ...`
  - `grafana-util list-alert-mute-timings ...`
  - `grafana-util list-alert-templates ...`

The alerting export root is `alerts/raw/`, with one subdirectory per resource kind.

Default layout:

- `alerts/raw/rules/<folderUID>/<ruleGroup>/<title>__<uid>.json`
- `alerts/raw/contact-points/<name>/<name>__<uid>.json`
- `alerts/raw/mute-timings/<name>/<name>.json`
- `alerts/raw/policies/notification-policies.json`
- `alerts/raw/templates/<name>/<name>.json`

Alerting export documents and the root `index.json` carry both:

- `apiVersion`: the older tool document version marker kept for compatibility
- `schemaVersion`: the current export schema marker used by newer import and diff flows

### Import behavior by resource kind

- rules: create by default, update by `uid` when `--replace-existing` is set
- contact points: create by default, update by `uid` when `--replace-existing` is set
- mute timings: create by default, update by `name` when `--replace-existing` is set
- notification policies: always applied as one policy tree with `PUT`
- notification templates: applied with `PUT`; when `--replace-existing` is set, fetch the current template version first and send it back with the update payload
- import `--dry-run` predicts `would-create`, `would-update`, or `would-fail-existing` without mutating Grafana
- `--diff-dir` compares normalized import payloads with live provisioning resources and prints a unified diff when they differ

Template handling notes:

- Grafana template identity is the template `name`
- template list may return JSON `null`; treat that as an empty list
- template updates should strip `name` from the request body because the API path already carries the name
- without `--replace-existing`, importing an existing template should fail fast instead of silently updating it

### Alerting import shape and rejection rules

- Import accepts the tool-owned document format emitted by `grafana-util alert export`
- Import accepts both current tool documents with `schemaVersion` and older tool documents that only carry `apiVersion`
- `detect_document_kind(...)` also accepts plain resource-shaped JSON for rules/contact points/mute timings/policies/templates
- Grafana official provisioning `/export` payloads are intentionally rejected for API import
- Round-trip import is only guaranteed for the tool-owned export format emitted by `grafana-util alert export`
- Reject the combined `alerts/` export root on import; require callers to point at `alerts/raw/`

### Dashboard-linked alert rules

Alert rules may contain `__dashboardUid__` and `__panelId__` in annotations.

Export behavior:

- preserve the original linkage fields
- export extra linked-dashboard metadata used for import-time repair
- when the source dashboard still exists during export, enrich metadata with:
  - `dashboardTitle`
  - `folderTitle`
  - `folderUid`
  - `dashboardSlug`
  - `panelTitle`
  - `panelType`

Import behavior:

1. try the original `__dashboardUid__`
2. if `--dashboard-uid-map` is present, apply that mapping first
3. if `--panel-id-map` is present, rewrite `__panelId__` using the mapped source dashboard UID plus source panel ID
4. if the target Grafana has the mapped or original dashboard UID, stop there
5. otherwise fall back to exported dashboard metadata
6. search target dashboards by exported title, then narrow by folder title and slug
7. rewrite `__dashboardUid__` only when that fallback search resolves to exactly one dashboard

Current limitation:

- automatic fallback only rewrites `__dashboardUid__`
- `__panelId__` is preserved unless `--panel-id-map` is supplied
- panel matching is intentionally explicit; there is no heuristic panel-title-based rewrite

### Mapping file formats

Dashboard UID map:

```json
{
  "old-dashboard-uid": "new-dashboard-uid"
}
```

Panel ID map:

```json
{
  "old-dashboard-uid": {
    "7": "19"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- both mapping loaders coerce keys and values to strings
- panel maps are keyed by source dashboard UID, then source panel ID
- explicit maps take precedence over fallback dashboard metadata matching

### Live validation notes

- Primary automated coverage lives in `python/python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`
- Container-based validation was done against Grafana `12.4.1`
- Verified round-trip coverage includes:
  - rules
  - contact points
  - mute timings
  - notification policies
  - notification templates
  - dashboard-linked rules with repaired `__dashboardUid__`

## Grafana API Endpoints Used

This section lists the Grafana HTTP API paths used by this project. It is intended as a maintainer map of what each endpoint means to Grafana and how the Python and Rust implementations use it.

### Dashboard and shared lookup APIs

| Method | Endpoint | Grafana meaning | Project usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/search` | Search Grafana objects. In this project it is always called with `type=dash-db` plus pagination params. | List dashboards for export and search dashboards by title when repairing linked alert-rule dashboard references. |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboards/uid/{uid}` | Fetch one dashboard plus Grafana `meta` fields by dashboard UID. | Export a dashboard by UID, and inspect dashboard metadata during alert-rule linked-dashboard repair. |
| `POST` | `/api/dashboards/db` | Create or update a dashboard from the standard dashboard import payload. Grafana expects a wrapped payload such as `{dashboard, folderUid, overwrite, message}`. | Import dashboards from the tool's raw dashboard files. |
| `GET` | `/api/folders/{uid}` | Fetch one Grafana folder plus its parent chain metadata. | Resolve folder tree paths during export and detect whether a folder UID already exists before `--ensure-folders` import runs. |
| `POST` | `/api/folders` | Create one Grafana folder, optionally nested under `parentUid`. | Recreate missing folder chains from `raw/folders.json` when operators opt into `--ensure-folders`. |
| `GET` | `/api/datasources` | List datasource definitions known to Grafana. | Build the datasource catalog used by dashboard prompt export so datasource references can be rewritten into Grafana import placeholders. |

Notes:

- Normal dashboard placement still flows through `folderUid` inside the dashboard import payload. The dedicated folder API is only used when `--ensure-folders` explicitly asks the tool to recreate missing destination folders first.
- The alerting utility reuses `/api/search` and `/api/dashboards/uid/{uid}` only for linked-dashboard metadata lookup and repair, not for dashboard export/import.

### Alerting provisioning APIs

| Method | Endpoint | Grafana meaning | Project usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/alert-rules` | List all provisioned alert rules. | Export alert rules. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/alert-rules/{uid}` | Fetch one alert rule by UID. | Check whether a rule already exists before update/replace flows. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/provisioning/alert-rules` | Create a new alert rule from a provisioning-style rule payload. | Import a rule when not replacing an existing one. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/provisioning/alert-rules/{uid}` | Replace an existing alert rule by UID. | Import a rule when `--replace-existing` is set. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/contact-points` | List provisioned contact points. | Export contact points and detect existing identities before updates. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/provisioning/contact-points` | Create a new contact point. | Import a contact point when not replacing an existing one. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/provisioning/contact-points/{uid}` | Replace an existing contact point by UID. | Import a contact point when `--replace-existing` is set. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/mute-timings` | List provisioned mute timings. | Export mute timings and detect existing identities before updates. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/provisioning/mute-timings` | Create a new mute timing. | Import a mute timing when not replacing an existing one. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/provisioning/mute-timings/{name}` | Replace an existing mute timing by name. | Import a mute timing when `--replace-existing` is set. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/policies` | Fetch the notification policy tree. Grafana models policies as one tree, not as many independent objects. | Export the policy tree. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/provisioning/policies` | Replace the notification policy tree. | Import the policy tree. The tool always uses `PUT` because this resource is tree-shaped. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/templates` | List notification templates. Grafana may return JSON `null` when none exist. | Export templates and detect existing template names. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/provisioning/templates/{name}` | Fetch one notification template by name. | Read the current template version before a replace/update. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/provisioning/templates/{name}` | Replace a notification template by name. | Import or update a template. The request body intentionally omits `name` because the API path already carries the identity. |

Alerting import format notes:

- The tool accepts its own tool-owned export documents, not Grafana's official provisioning `/export` documents.
- The create/update payload shapes for these APIs are not the same as Grafana's `/export` response shape, which is why the project normalizes resources into its own round-trip format first.

## Access Utility

### Current scope

Primary access entrypoints are `python3 -m grafana_utils access ...` and `cargo run --bin grafana-util -- access ...`.

- `user list`
- `user add`
- `user modify`
- `user delete`
- `team list`
- `team modify`
- `team add`
- `team delete`
- `service-account list`
- `service-account add`
- `service-account token add`
- `service-account delete`
- `service-account token delete`
- `group` alias for `team`

Current team creation command shape:

```bash
python3 -m grafana_utils access team add \
  --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --token "$GRAFANA_API_TOKEN" \
  --name platform-operators \
  --email platform-operators@example.com \
  --member alice@example.com \
  --admin bob@example.com
```

### Auth constraints

- `user list --scope org` may use token auth or Basic auth
- `user list --scope global` requires Basic auth and should be treated as a Grafana server-admin workflow
- `user add` requires Basic auth and should be treated as a Grafana server-admin workflow
- `user modify` requires Basic auth and should be treated as a Grafana server-admin workflow
- `user delete --scope global` requires Basic auth and should be treated as a Grafana server-admin workflow
- `user delete --scope org` may use token auth or Basic auth
- `team list` is org-scoped and may use token auth or Basic auth
- `team modify` is org-scoped and may use token auth or Basic auth
- `team add` is org-scoped and may use token auth or Basic auth
- `team delete` is org-scoped and may use token auth or Basic auth
- service-account commands are org-scoped and may use token auth or Basic auth
- do not silently fall back from a token-only global request into a weaker behavior; fail early with a clear error instead

### Expected output modes

- compact text by default
- `--table`
- `--csv`
- `--json`

## Validation

Common checks:

```bash
poetry install --with dev
poetry run python -m grafana_utils -h
poetry run python -m build --sdist --wheel
poetry run python -m unittest tests.test_python_dashboard_cli
poetry run python -m unittest tests.test_python_alert_cli
poetry run python -m unittest tests.test_python_access_cli
poetry run python -m unittest tests.test_python_packaging
PYTHONPATH=python poetry run python -m unittest -v
make help

make test-rust-live
make test-alert-live
make test-access-live
make test-python-datasource-live
make test-datasource-live

python3 -m pip install --no-deps --target /tmp/grafana-util-install .
python3 -m unittest tests.test_python_dashboard_cli
python3 -m unittest tests.test_python_alert_cli
python3 -m unittest tests.test_python_access_cli
python3 -m unittest tests.test_python_packaging
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v
```

Development environment notes:

- Poetry is the standard maintainer path for Python development and test execution.
- Keep `python3 -m pip install ...` commands for packaged-install validation and release checks.
- The project still builds through the existing Python packaging backend; Poetry only standardizes environment management here.

Dashboard governance gate notes:

- keep inspect extraction and policy evaluation as separate layers:
  - `grafana-util dashboard inspect-export --report governance-json` and `--report json` extract facts
  - `scripts/check_dashboard_governance.py` applies team-specific policy and returns a CI-friendly exit code
- prefer one governance-json-first gate contract:
  - one policy JSON such as `examples/dashboard-governance-policy.json`
  - one governance report from `dashboard inspect-export --report governance-json`
  - one flat query report from `dashboard inspect-export --report json`
  - keep `--import-dir` only as a fallback for older governance artifacts that do not yet carry the dependency facts the checker wants
- when present, the checker should prefer dependency facts from governance JSON `dashboardDependencies` rows over rescanning raw dashboards
- the first-pass blocking rules are:
  - datasource family allowlist
  - datasource uid allowlist
  - unknown datasource identity
  - mixed-datasource dashboards reported by governance risk records
  - panel plugin allowlist
  - library panel allowlist
  - allowed dashboard folder prefixes for routing/governance boundaries
  - undefined datasource variables referenced in panel/query datasource fields
  - max queries per dashboard
  - max queries per panel
  - max query complexity score
  - max dashboard complexity score
  - SQL `select *`
  - missing SQL Grafana time-filter macros
  - broad Loki selectors and regexes
- raw governance `riskRecords` are surfaced as warnings in the checker result. Set `enforcement.failOnWarnings=true` in the policy file if CI should fail when those warnings are present.
- keep the gate external until the policy contract settles across teams; that lets operators change policy without forcing a new CLI/runtime contract.
- current safe ownership/routing subset is explicit folder-prefix policy via `routing.allowedFolderPrefixes`. Do not infer team ownership from dashboard titles, tags, or free-form folder names until inspect/governance outputs expose a stable owner/team field.

Example CI flow:

```bash
grafana-util dashboard inspect-export \
  --import-dir ./dashboards/raw \
  --report governance-json > governance.json

grafana-util dashboard inspect-export \
  --import-dir ./dashboards/raw \
  --report json > queries.json

python3 scripts/check_dashboard_governance.py \
  --policy examples/dashboard-governance-policy.json \
  --governance governance.json \
  --queries queries.json \
  --json-output governance-check.json
```

Fallback CI flow for older exports:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_dashboard_governance.py \
  --policy examples/dashboard-governance-policy.json \
  --governance governance.json \
  --queries queries.json \
  --import-dir ./dashboards/raw \
  --json-output governance-check.json
```

Rust live smoke test notes:

- `make test-rust-live` runs `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`
- `make test-sync-live` runs the Rust sync-only Docker smoke path, which prepares a minimal dashboard + alert export fixture and then exercises `sync bundle` plus `sync bundle-preflight`
- `make test-alert-live` runs the combined alert-only Rust Docker smoke, and the narrower `make test-alert-live-artifact` / `make test-alert-live-replay` targets are available when you only need one half of the alert contract.
- the script defaults to `grafana/grafana:12.4.1` and binds Grafana to a random localhost port unless `GRAFANA_PORT` is set explicitly
- the script seeds one Prometheus datasource, additional Loki/InfluxDB/PostgreSQL/Elasticsearch/Tempo datasources for inspection coverage, one simple dashboard, one broader core-family inspection dashboard, one additional org-scoped dashboard, and one webhook contact point
- access coverage: user org/global delete plus global/org export/diff/import dry-run/live replay with structured dry-run JSON and export artifact metadata checks, team add/list/modify/delete plus export/import dry-run/live replay with artifact metadata checks, org add/delete/list plus export/diff/import dry-run/live replay with artifact metadata checks, and service-account add/export/import dry-run/live replay/diff changed-same/token-delete/delete/list with artifact metadata checks
- datasource coverage: add dry-run/live create, secret-bearing add/modify persisted-state checks for `secureJsonFields`, delete dry-run/live delete, export, single-org import dry-run, multi-org export, routed `--use-export-org --only-org-id` dry-run preview, routed existing/missing/`would-create` status-matrix dry-run preview, and live missing-org recreate/import
- dashboard coverage: export, prompt export datasource rewrite, offline `inspect-export` report/governance JSON, live `inspect-live` report/governance JSON, normalized `inspect-export` vs `inspect-live` parity checks for report/governance JSON, datasource-family report filtering, diff same, diff drifted, dry-run export, dry-run import, delete-and-import restore, multi-org export, routed `--use-export-org --only-org-id` dry-run preview, routed existing/missing/`would-create` status-matrix dry-run preview, and live missing-org recreate/import
- alerting coverage: export artifact/index sanity checks, structured `alert diff --json` and `alert import --dry-run --json` previews, fixture-driven recreate runtime regressions for rules/contact-points/mute-timings/templates, fixture-driven policies update-only parity, diff same, diff changed, live update replay, missing-remote diff after contact-point deletion, and recreate import back to same-state
- sync coverage: `sync bundle` source-bundle contract checks, alert replay artifact preservation/ignore checks, cross-domain summary/text contract checks, and bundle-preflight sanity against a locally generated source bundle
- destructive-path transport coverage: the live script now runs representative Rust access delete commands with `--insecure` against the local HTTP Grafana smoke environment; `--ca-cert` remains covered at parser/runtime unit level because the script does not start Grafana over TLS
- useful overrides: `GRAFANA_IMAGE`, `GRAFANA_PORT`, `GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`, `CARGO_BIN`

Python access live smoke test notes:

- `make test-access-live` runs `scripts/test-python-access-live-grafana.sh`
- the script defaults to `grafana/grafana:12.4.1` and binds Grafana to a random localhost port unless `GRAFANA_PORT` is set explicitly
- user coverage: add, modify, global delete, org delete, global list, org list
- team coverage: add, list, modify, delete
- org coverage: add, delete, list
- service-account coverage: add, export, import dry-run/live replay, diff changed/same, delete, token add, token delete, list
- destructive-path transport coverage: the live script now runs representative delete commands with `--insecure` against the local HTTP Grafana testbed; `--ca-cert` remains covered at parser/runtime unit level because this smoke path does not start Grafana over TLS
- useful overrides: `GRAFANA_IMAGE`, `GRAFANA_PORT`, `GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`, `PYTHON_BIN`

Python datasource live smoke test notes:

- `make test-python-datasource-live` runs `scripts/test-python-datasource-live-grafana.sh`
- the script defaults to `grafana/grafana:12.4.1` and binds Grafana to a random localhost port unless `GRAFANA_PORT` is set explicitly
- datasource coverage: add dry-run/live create, secret-bearing add/modify persisted-state checks for `secureJsonFields`, delete dry-run/live delete, export, single-org import dry-run, multi-org export, routed `--use-export-org --only-org-id` dry-run preview, routed `--create-missing-orgs --dry-run` preview, and live missing-org recreate/import
- Grafana secret persistence note: these smoke checks intentionally verify durable `secureJsonFields` markers rather than assuming Grafana will echo request-payload replacement semantics for `secureJsonData` on modify.
- useful overrides: `GRAFANA_IMAGE`, `GRAFANA_PORT`, `GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`, `PYTHON_BIN`

Combined datasource live smoke notes:

- `make test-datasource-live` runs `scripts/test-combined-live-grafana.sh`
- the wrapper is fail-fast and runs the Rust live smoke first, then the Python datasource live smoke
- use this combined gate when you want one command that rechecks datasource-related runtime behavior across both runtimes against local Docker Grafana

Developer sample-data seed notes:

- `make seed-grafana-sample-data` runs `scripts/seed-grafana-sample-data.sh`
- `make destroy-grafana-sample-data` runs `scripts/seed-grafana-sample-data.sh --destroy`
- `make reset-grafana-all-data` runs `scripts/seed-grafana-sample-data.sh --reset-all-data --yes`
- defaults to `http://localhost:3000` with `admin/admin`
- the script is idempotent and reuses existing orgs, datasources, and folders when possible
- destroy mode removes only the known sample resources; it does not wipe arbitrary Grafana content
- reset-all-data mode is intentionally destructive and is only for disposable local Grafana instances used during developer testing
- current seeded layout covers:
  - org `1` with `Smoke Prometheus`, `Smoke Loki`, `Platform`, `Platform / Infra`, and dashboards `smoke-main`, `smoke-prom-only`, `query-smoke`, `subfolder-main`
  - org `2` `Org Two` with dashboard `org-two-main`
  - org `3` `QA Org` with dashboard `qa-overview`
  - org `4` `Audit Org` with dashboard `audit-home`
- useful overrides: `GRAFANA_URL`, `GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`

## Documentation split

- `README.md`: public usage and high-level behavior
- `docs/DEVELOPER.md`: maintenance notes, internal architecture, compatibility rules, and implementation tradeoffs
- `docs/internal/ai-status.md` / `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`: internal working notes only; do not treat them as public GitHub-facing documentation

## Auth Notes

- Shared CLI auth now supports `--prompt-password` for Basic auth without echo.
- Reject `--prompt-password` when `--token` is also set.
- Reject `--prompt-password` when `--basic-password` is also set.
- Require `--basic-user` with `--prompt-password`.

Documentation policy:

- keep `README.md` suitable for GitHub readers
- keep environment-specific validation logs, migration notes, and maintainer-only tradeoffs in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`
- avoid relying on `docs/internal/ai-status.md` and `docs/internal/ai-changes.md` for public project documentation
- if user-facing release history is needed, prefer a curated `CHANGELOG.md`
