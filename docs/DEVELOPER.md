# Developer Notes

This document is for maintainers. Keep `README.md` and the user guides operator-facing; keep dual-runtime implementation notes, release ritual, and validation guidance here.

## Documentation Contract

- Keep `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, and `docs/user-guide-TW.md` focused on the maintained user-facing `grafana-util` command surface.
- Keep Python implementation notes in maintainer-only docs such as this file and the internal reference pages under `docs/`.
- When command behavior or parameter shapes change, update both user guides together.
- When Python/Rust parity or validation behavior changes, update maintainer docs here instead of surfacing that detail in README unless operators need it.

## Repository Scope

### User-facing runtime

- `rust/src/cli.rs`: unified Rust entrypoint for namespaced command dispatch and `--help-full`.
- `rust/src/dashboard/`: dashboard export, import, diff, inspect, prompt-export, and screenshot workflows.
- `rust/src/datasource.rs`: datasource list, export, import, diff, add, modify, and delete workflows.
- `rust/src/alert.rs`: alerting export, import, diff, and shared alert document helpers.
- `rust/src/alert_list.rs`: alert list rendering and list command orchestration.
- `rust/src/access/`: access org, user, team, and service-account workflows plus shared renderers and request helpers.
- `rust/src/sync/`: staged sync bundle, preflight, review, and apply flows.

### Developer-only validation and parity runtime

- `python/grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`: unified Python dispatcher used for parity testing and source-tree validation.
- `python/grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`: Python dashboard facade.
- `python/grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`: Python datasource facade.
- `python/grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`: Python alert facade.
- `python/grafana_utils/access_cli.py`: Python access facade.
- `python/grafana_utils/http_transport.py`: shared Python transport abstraction.
- `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/`, `python/grafana_utils/datasource/`, `python/grafana_utils/access/`, `python/grafana_utils/alerts/`: Python workflow and helper modules used to keep behavior traceable against the Rust surface.
- `python/tests/`: Python regression coverage used as a secondary implementation and validation lane.

### Build, scripts, and docs

- `Makefile`: maintainer shortcuts for build, test, lint, and version bump flows.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: CI entrypoint that should stay aligned with local quality gates.
- `scripts/check-python-quality.sh`: centralized Python validation gate.
- `scripts/check-rust-quality.sh`: centralized Rust validation gate.
- `scripts/set-version.sh`: shared version bump helper for `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.lock`.
- `docs/overview-rust.md`: Rust architecture walkthrough.
- `docs/overview-python.md`: Python maintainer architecture walkthrough.
- `docs/core-python-call-hierarchy.md`: Python call graph reference for maintainers.
- `docs/unit-test-inventory.md`: Python and Rust test inventory reference for maintainers.

## Shortest Modification Paths

- `dashboard inspect` contract changes: start in `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, then split between `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_query.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_live.rs`, and `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_live_tui.rs`; typed summary/report boundaries live in `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_summary.rs` and `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_report.rs`.
- `dashboard inspect` test changes: keep parser/help coverage near the relevant `*_cli_defs.rs`, and keep contract regressions in `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`.
- `sync` contract changes: start in `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, then route dispatch and helpers through `rust/src/sync/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync/live.rs`, `rust/src/sync/json.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_inputs.rs`, `rust/src/sync/staged_documents.rs`, and `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs`; `live.rs`, `staged_documents.rs`, and `workbench.rs` own the typed apply/live boundary.
- `sync` test changes: keep CLI and live regressions in `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs` and `rust/src/sync/rust_tests.rs`.

## Version Workflow

- `dev` is the preview branch; `main` is the release branch.
- `VERSION` is the checked-in maintainer version source.
- Use `make print-version` to inspect the current checked-in version state across Python and Rust metadata.
- Use `make sync-version` after editing `VERSION` manually.
- Use `make set-release-version VERSION=X.Y.Z` when preparing `main` for release.
- Use `make set-dev-version VERSION=X.Y.Z DEV_ITERATION=N` when moving `dev` to the next preview cycle.
- Preferred release ritual:
  - work on `dev`
  - merge `dev` into `main`
  - run `make set-release-version VERSION=X.Y.Z` on `main`
  - run `make test`
  - create tag `vX.Y.Z`
  - merge `main` back into `dev`
  - run `make set-dev-version VERSION=X.Y.$((Z+1)) DEV_ITERATION=1` or the intended next preview
- Treat the post-release `main -> dev` sync as required so CI, docs, scripts, and version metadata do not drift.

## Runtime Positioning

- The maintained operator entrypoint is `grafana-util`.
- The Rust binary is the primary user-facing runtime.
- The Python implementation remains in-repo for developer validation, parity checking, and source-tree testing.
- Keep user docs Rust-first, but do not remove internal Python maintenance guidance unless the Python implementation is actually retired.

## Python Maintainer Notes

- Python remains useful for:
  - parity checks when Rust behavior changes
  - workflow prototyping and comparison during refactors
  - validation against existing Python unit and smoke coverage
- Keep Python command examples inside maintainer docs only.
- Prefer `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v` for full Python validation.
- Keep Python version metadata aligned with Rust version metadata through the shared version bump flow.

## Quality Gates

- `make quality-python` runs the Python validation lane used for parity and regression checking.
- `make quality-rust` runs the Rust validation lane used by the maintained runtime.
- `make test` should remain the broad maintainer gate that exercises both implementations where applicable.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` is release-blocking in CI.
- Keep CI wired to shared scripts rather than duplicating logic in workflow YAML.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep README and user guides free of Python installation or entrypoint guidance unless Python becomes a supported user distribution again.
- Keep internal Python docs available for maintainers while the dual implementation still exists.
- If a workflow change affects operator behavior, update both user guides in the same change.
- If a parity or validation rule changes, update this file and the relevant internal reference docs in the same change.
- Historical notes in `docs/internal/` are archival and may still mention older Python/Rust rollout context.
