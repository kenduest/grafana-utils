## 2026-04-12 - Infer unique long option prefixes
- Mistake/Symptom: repeated focused Rust test attempts used invalid multiple `cargo test` filters, then Cargo printed `error: test failed, to rerun pass --lib` after normal lib-test failures, creating noisy and misleading iteration.
- Root Cause: `cargo test` accepts at most one positional test filter before `--`; Cargo's `--lib` line is a rerun hint for the failed target, not a diagnostic or a better next command.
- Fix: use one broad, intentional filter such as `long_option` or a full suite target; treat `to rerun pass --lib` as informational unless narrowing to the lib target is specifically useful.
- Prevention: before running focused Rust tests, choose one filter string or run the owning suite; do not concatenate multiple test names in one `cargo test` command.

## 2026-04-06 - keyring needs explicit backend features on macOS
- Mistake/Symptom: a macOS Keychain compatibility smoke failed because `SystemOsSecretStore` could not read an item that had just been written with the `security` CLI.
- Root Cause: `keyring = "3"` was added without `apple-native`, and the crate falls back to its `mock` backend on macOS when that feature is absent.
- Fix: enable `keyring` with `features = ["apple-native"]` on the macOS target and keep a manual ignored smoke that checks `security` CLI interoperability.
- Prevention: when adopting `keyring`, always verify the target-specific backend feature set instead of assuming the real platform store is enabled by default.
