# ai-status.md

Historical note:

- Older entries describe the repo state and `TODO.md` backlog as they existed on the entry date.
- `TODO.md` now tracks only the active backlog; completed or superseded TODO items moved to `docs/internal/todo-archive.md`.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Split Rust Sync Workbench Into Builder Modules
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs`, `rust/src/sync/summary_builder.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_builder.rs`, `rust/src/sync/plan_builder.rs`, `rust/src/sync/apply_builder.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs` carried normalization, summary, source-bundle, plan, and apply builders together with the shared low-level helpers. That made the facade file the main maintenance hotspot and mixed orchestration with implementation details.
- Current Update: Split the builder-heavy work into sibling modules for summary, bundle, plan, and apply construction while keeping `crate::sync::workbench` as the stable public facade and entrypoint for existing callers.
- Result: The sync workbench surface is now thinner and easier to navigate, with the public API unchanged and the implementation grouped by builder responsibility instead of one large monolith.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Phase Split Dashboard Import Flow
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/import_lookup.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/import_validation.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/import_builders.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/import_render.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`
- Baseline: The dashboard import module still mixes cache lookups, export-org validation, payload/build helpers, render helpers, and the main import orchestration in one large file, which makes the flow harder to maintain even though behavior is already pinned by focused dashboard tests.
- Current Update: Split the import flow into lookup, validation, render, and compare helper modules, then rewired the facade to keep the orchestration and public test surface stable.
- Result: `cargo check --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet --lib` passed and the focused dashboard import regressions passed, including dry-run rendering, routed preview, auth header wiring, folder inventory collection, and ensure-folders orchestration.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Split Dashboard Rust Query And Governance Tests
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_query_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance_rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: The dashboard Rust test suite still keeps the query-analysis and governance-contract regressions in the oversized umbrella file, even though the live inspect coverage already has a dedicated split.
- Current Update: Moved the core query-report contract regressions into `inspect_query_rust_tests.rs` and the governance summary/risk-registry regressions into `inspect_governance_rust_tests.rs`, then wired both modules into the dashboard test tree.
- Result: `cargo check --quiet --lib` passed, `cargo test --quiet --lib inspect_query_rust_tests` passed, and `cargo test --quiet --lib inspect_governance_rust_tests` passed.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Phase Split Dashboard Export Inspect Rendering
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `analyze_export_dir_at_path` still mixed report dispatch, payload construction, and text/JSON rendering in one long function even though the summary and query-report types were already separate.
- Current Update: Split the export-inspect render path into dedicated helpers for report output and summary output, so the dispatcher now reads as a short phase gate instead of a single mixed block.
- Result: The dispatcher is now phase-oriented and the requested Rust validation targets passed after the refactor.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Document Typed Contract Boundaries
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The maintainer docs still named the broad inspect and sync split, but they did not call out the typed summary/report and apply/live ownership boundaries directly.
- Current Update: Added concise pointers to `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_summary.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_report.rs`, `rust/src/sync/live.rs`, `rust/src/sync/staged_documents.rs`, and `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs` so the typed contract boundaries are easy to find.
- Result: Maintainers can now jump straight to the typed inspect and sync contract files without reconstructing the split from the wider module map.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Document Rust Contract/Test Split Paths
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The maintainer docs still described inspect and sync in broad module-map terms, so the shortest edit path for contract changes and their paired tests was not called out explicitly.
- Current Update: Added high-level pointers for the inspect and sync contract files, their matching Rust test files, and the recommended starting points for common parser, dispatch, and live-plumbing edits.
- Result: Maintainers can now jump straight to the right contract and test files without reconstructing the split from the full module tree.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Finalize Rust Module Map Sweep
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The maintainer overview still lagged the final visible Rust tree in a few helper references, so the last pass needed to name the settled `dashboard/inspect_query.rs` and sync helper splits explicitly.
- Current Update: Reconciled the overview with the visible module layout and kept the internal trace focused on the final `dashboard/`, `access/`, and `sync/` structure.
- Result: The Rust maintainer docs now describe the current module tree without stale helper names.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Extract Rust Sync Document Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync/live.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/json.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_inputs.rs`, `rust/src/sync/staged_documents.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs` still carries JSON loading, bundle normalization, staged-document lineage, render helpers, and apply-validation helpers inline, which makes the sync facade harder to scan and keeps unrelated helper roles in one large file.
- Current Update: Split the sync helper surface into `json.rs`, `bundle_inputs.rs`, and `staged_documents.rs`, then re-exported the existing helper names from `sync/mod.rs` so the CLI, live, and audit paths keep working through the same contract.
- Result: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs` is now a thin command facade, and the focused sync library check passes; the requested sync CLI test target is still blocked by an unrelated dashboard test import error outside the sync slice.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Refresh Rust Maintainer Module Map
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The maintainer docs still needed one last pass after the Rust refactors settled so the visible module map and trace notes would match the final `dashboard/`, `access/`, and `sync/` layout.
- Current Update: Tightened the overview to name the current dashboard live-inspect split, the access directory layout, and the sync `cli.rs` / `live.rs` split, then recorded this docs-only maintainability pass in the internal trace files.
- Result: The Rust maintainer docs now describe the final visible module tree without stale pre-refactor paths.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Extract Rust Sync Live Helper Module
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync/live.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/sync/cli.rs` still owned the live fetch/apply helpers plus the CLI dispatcher, which made the file harder to scan and duplicated the same live plumbing that already existed in the sync module.
- Current Update: Moved the shared live fetch/apply helpers into `rust/src/sync/live.rs`, trimmed the CLI file down to orchestration/output handling, and redirected the focused live-helper tests to the shared module.
- Result: The sync CLI now keeps the live HTTP/apply plumbing in a dedicated module and the focused Rust sync CLI test suite passes.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Align Rust Maintainer Overview With Current Module Layout
- State: Done
- Scope: `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust maintainer overview still used stale flat-file wording for dashboard helpers and did not describe the current `sync/` directory split, so the second-pass cleanup notes could drift from the live module tree.
- Current Update: Reworded the overview to describe the current `dashboard/`, `access/`, and `sync/` module layouts, including the `sync/mod.rs` and `sync/cli.rs` split, and kept the trace logs aligned with that documentation-only refresh.
- Result: The Rust maintainer docs now match the current module structure without implying old flat-file paths.

## 2026-03-24 - Task: Clean Up Rust Access Maintainability Signals
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/mod.rs`, `rust/src/access/pending_delete.rs`, `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust access facade still carried generated call-graph notes, `pending_delete.rs` still described itself as staging-only, and the Rust overview still named the pre-split `access.rs` / `access_*` layout.
- Current Update: Removed the stale staging and call-graph commentary, rewrote the delete module headers to describe the handlers they actually own, and updated the Rust architecture overview to point at `rust/src/access/mod.rs` plus the current `rust/src/access/` module layout.
- Result: The Rust access comments and maintainer docs now match the current module structure without implying unfinished wiring.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Formalize Version Sync Workflow
- State: Done
- Scope: `VERSION`, `scripts/set-version.sh`, `Makefile`, `tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `tests/test_python_version_script.py`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had a checked-in `VERSION` file and an unpublished `scripts/set-version.sh`, but the file was stale, the script only updated `pyproject.toml` and `rust/Cargo.toml`, `Makefile` exposed no version targets, and release merges still left maintainers hand-fixing `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.lock`.
- Current Update: Updated `VERSION` to the current release line, taught `scripts/set-version.sh` to sync `rust/Cargo.lock` and to accept test-time path overrides, exposed `print-version`, `sync-version`, `set-release-version`, and `set-dev-version` in `Makefile`, and added focused Python tests for the script plus packaging assertions for the new workflow files and targets.
- Result: The repo now has one documented version-sync path for preview and release bumps, and the lockfile package version no longer drifts from `pyproject.toml` / `rust/Cargo.toml` during scripted version changes.
## 2026-03-23 - Task: Specialize Rust Dashboard Inspect-Live Interactive TUI
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_live_tui.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `dashboard inspect-live --interactive` still routed through the shared browser path, so operators got a flat list instead of a dashboard-specific review surface for governance rollups, query rows, and risk artifacts.
- Current Update: Routed live inspect into the dedicated `inspect_live_tui` module, kept the three-pane operator layout, and expanded risk grouping so dashboard risk rows, query audits, and risk records all appear in the specialized TUI. The test-only helpers now pin the group counts and group-filtered item projection for the new live review surface.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspect-live now uses a command-specific interactive TUI instead of the generic browser path, while the non-interactive artifact outputs stay unchanged.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Specialize Rust Dashboard Topology Interactive TUI
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/topology_tui.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `dashboard topology --interactive` still projected topology nodes into the shared browser path, so operators got a flat review surface instead of a topology-specific grouping layout for datasources, dashboards, panels, variables, and alert resources.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated topology TUI with grouped node kinds on the left, filtered nodes in the middle, and node metadata plus inbound/outbound edge detail on the right. The non-interactive graph outputs stay unchanged, and test-only interactive behavior still uses the browser projection so the existing harness remains stable.
- Result: Rust topology interactive review now has a command-specific operator layout instead of the generic shared browser, while helper tests pin the group counts and filtered node projection.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Shared Rust Interactive Browsers For Review-Heavy Commands
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/interactive_browser.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust only had one full-screen TUI path, `sync review --interactive`. Other review-heavy commands such as `dashboard impact`, `dashboard topology`, `dashboard governance-gate`, `dashboard inspect-live`, and `sync audit` were text/json-only, even though they already emitted artifact documents that were more suitable for browsing than for one-shot rendering.
- Current Update: Added a shared read-only list/detail TUI browser and wired first-pass `--interactive` browsing into the five review-heavy commands above. The browser stays intentionally generic for now: a summary block, an item list on the left, and a detail pane on the right, with the command-specific item builders projecting existing artifact rows into browser items instead of duplicating five custom TUI implementations.
- Result: Rust now has a consistent interactive browsing path for impact, topology, governance findings, inspect-live artifacts, and sync drift review, while keeping the existing non-interactive output formats intact.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Specialize Rust Dashboard Impact Interactive TUI
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/impact_tui.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `dashboard impact --interactive` existed only as a projection into the shared browser, so operators could browse rows but still lacked a blast-radius-specific layout that separated resource groups from affected items and detailed impact context.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated `impact_tui` module and routed `dashboard impact --interactive` into a three-pane operator layout: impact groups on the left, affected items in the middle, and item details on the right. Groups now summarize the blast radius by dashboards, alert rules, mute timings, contact points, policies, and templates, while focused item lists stay scoped to the selected group.
- Result: Rust now has a command-specific impact TUI instead of only the generic browser, making datasource migration and outage review materially easier without changing the non-interactive impact contract.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Specialize Rust Sync Audit Interactive TUI
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/audit_tui.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `sync audit --interactive` only projected drift rows into the shared browser, so operators could browse drift records but still lacked a triage-specific layout for missing-live, missing-lock, and drift-detected review.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated `audit_tui` module and routed `sync audit --interactive` into a three-pane triage layout: status groups on the left, filtered drift rows in the middle, and diagnostic detail on the right. The groups now reflect audit triage categories directly, and the row projection stays focused on baseline/current status, source path, drifted fields, and checksums.
- Result: Rust sync audit now has a command-specific terminal triage surface instead of a generic browser, which makes lock drift review much closer to an operator workflow.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Specialize Rust Governance Gate Interactive TUI
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate_tui.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `dashboard governance-gate --interactive` only projected ordered findings into the shared browser, so operators could browse rows but still lacked a dedicated findings-review layout for separating violations from warnings and drilling into scope/reason context quickly.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated `governance_gate_tui` module and routed `dashboard governance-gate --interactive` into a three-pane findings reviewer: finding groups on the left, filtered findings in the middle, and detailed scope/reason context on the right. Violations and warnings now become explicit review groups while the existing non-interactive outputs and non-zero exit semantics remain unchanged.
- Result: Rust governance gate now has a command-specific interactive reviewer instead of a generic browser, making policy-triage workflows much closer to an operator review surface.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Prometheus Query Cost Audit Signals
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust query audits already scored broad selectors, regex-heavy selectors, long range windows, and unscoped Loki search, but they still lacked more explicit Prometheus cost-shape signals such as aggregation depth, high-cardinality regex heuristics, or a stable query cost score that policies could enforce directly.
- Current Update: Extended `queryAudits` with `aggregationDepth`, `regexMatcherCount`, `estimatedSeriesRisk`, and `queryCostScore`, and added additive Prometheus reasons for high-cardinality regex usage and deeper aggregation layers. Wired the governance gate to enforce those new signals via `queries.forbidHighCardinalityRegex`, `queries.maxPrometheusAggregationDepth`, and `queries.maxPrometheusCostScore` while keeping the design artifact-driven.
- Result: Rust governance now carries a more operator-meaningful Prometheus query cost model, and CI policy can block queries that are structurally expensive even when they have not yet triggered live incidents.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Dashboard Graph Alias And Variable-Aware Topology
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard topology already rendered datasource, dashboard, and alert nodes from governance-json plus alert-contract artifacts, but it still lacked a unified `dashboard graph` entrypoint and had no variable-aware graph surface for panel/query variable extraction already present in inspect output.
- Current Update: Added a unified `grafana-util dashboard graph` alias for the topology command, widened the governance contract with `panelIds`, `panelVariables`, and `queryVariables`, and taught the topology builder to render panel and variable nodes with datasource -> variable -> panel -> dashboard -> alert chains. Mermaid, DOT, and JSON output now surface those new node kinds and relations deterministically.
- Result: The focused parser/help and topology regressions pass for the new graph surface. A broader `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet dashboard_rust_tests` sweep still reports unrelated preexisting strict-schema import failures outside this graph work.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Sync Audit And Field-Level Review Diff
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync/audit.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/review_tui.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust sync already had staged plan/review/apply contracts and a simple interactive review checklist, but it still lacked a CI-friendly drift guard and did not let operators inspect concrete field-level mutations before confirming a plan.
- Current Update: Added a new Rust `sync audit` command that builds deterministic checksum lock snapshots for managed resources, compares them against live state or a staged baseline lock, and reports drift such as missing-live, missing-lock, or changed managed fields. Added `--write-lock` and `--fail-on-drift` so the same command can bootstrap a lock file or fail CI when a managed Grafana resource drifts. Upgraded the interactive sync review TUI from a single checklist into two modes: the list view still toggles actionable operations, while `Enter` now opens a side-by-side live vs desired field diff for the selected operation and `c` confirms the filtered review.
- Result: Rust sync now has a first-pass GitOps drift guard and a materially stronger operator review surface. Teams can snapshot managed Grafana state into a lock artifact, audit live drift in CI, and inspect exact JSON field mutations before apply without leaving the terminal.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Query Audit Contract And Gate Enforcement
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard governance already emitted additive risk rows and some artifact-driven policy checks, but it still lacked a stable audit contract that could carry scored query/dashboard quality signals into gating without re-encoding each rule independently.
- Current Update: Added `queryAudits` and `dashboardAudits` to the governance contract with stable `score`, `severity`, `reasons`, and `recommendations`, then wired the governance gate to enforce those artifacts through max-score, max-reason-count, blocked-reason, and dashboard-load policy knobs. Updated all-org governance parity expectations and focused regressions so export and live governance stay aligned with the additive audit output.
- Result: Rust inspection now produces a reusable deep-query audit layer, and Rust governance-gate can block expensive dashboards using contract-level scored signals instead of only ad hoc point rules.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Deepen Rust Dashboard Topology And Impact Alert Classification
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard topology and impact already linked datasources to dashboards and treated alert-contract resources as a single generic alert bucket, but it still flattened alert kinds and only surfaced direct datasource/dashboard reachability.
- Current Update: Classified alert-contract nodes into `alert-rule`, `contact-point`, `mute-timing`, `notification-policy`, and `template`, then added richer edges for datasource/dashboard-backed alert rules and alert-plane references such as routes-to and uses-template where the contract references support them. Extended impact output with by-kind counts plus `affectedContactPoints`, `affectedPolicies`, and `affectedTemplates` while preserving the existing `alertResources` array.
- Result: Rust dashboard topology now shows a deeper alert-plane dependency graph, and datasource impact summaries can distinguish which alert artifacts and template dependencies are actually reachable from the selected datasource.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Schema Validation, Interactive Sync Review, And Concurrent Dashboard Scan
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/topology.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection already had family-aware query extraction, governance rollups, and a first governance-gate command, but it still lacked two operator-grade capabilities: static query quality auditing for Prometheus/Loki plus dashboard pressure signals, and artifact-driven topology/impact outputs that operators could feed into planning or CI review.
- Current Update: Added higher-signal Rust governance risks for broad Prometheus selectors, regex-heavy Prometheus matchers, large Prometheus range windows, unscoped Loki searches, oversized dashboards, and too-frequent dashboard refresh. Extended Rust `dashboard governance-gate` with matching artifact-driven policy knobs: `queries.forbidBroadPrometheusSelectors`, `queries.forbidRegexHeavyPrometheus`, `queries.maxPrometheusRangeWindowSeconds`, `queries.forbidUnscopedLokiSearch`, `dashboards.maxPanelsPerDashboard`, and `dashboards.minRefreshIntervalSeconds`. Added new Rust `dashboard topology` and `dashboard impact` commands that consume `governance-json` plus optional sync alert contract JSON and render deterministic text/JSON/Mermaid/DOT topology or datasource blast radius summaries without re-querying Grafana.
- Result: Rust now covers a more realistic advanced-ops loop instead of only structure extraction. Operators can statically audit expensive query/dashboard shapes, gate them in CI, render datasource-to-dashboard-to-alert dependency graphs, and ask for datasource-specific blast radius from saved artifacts.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Schema Validation, Interactive Sync Review, And Concurrent Dashboard Scan
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/src/dashboard/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/validate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/http.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/review_tui.rs`, `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had dashboard inspection, governance-gate, and staged sync review/apply flows, but it still lacked three larger operator-facing capabilities from the backlog: strict dashboard schema preflight, an interactive sync review surface, and a high-concurrency live dashboard scan path with progress reporting.
- Current Update: Added a new Rust `dashboard validate-export` command plus shared strict validator logic that checks raw dashboard exports for migration-required `schemaVersion`, web-import placeholders, legacy row layouts, and unsupported custom panel/datasource plugin types. Added `dashboard import --strict-schema [--target-schema-version N]` so the same validation can block dashboard import before dry-run/live writes. Added `sync review --interactive`, backed by a small `ratatui`/`crossterm` review UI that lets operators deselect actionable plan operations before the reviewed plan is stamped, while keeping summary and alert-assessment counts consistent. Added `dashboard inspect-live --concurrency N --progress`, backed by a parallel raw-snapshot writer using `rayon` and `indicatif`, so current-org live inspect can fetch many dashboards concurrently and show a progress bar before the existing report/governance analysis runs.
- Result: Rust now has first-pass implementations for the three larger architecture items instead of only incremental governance rules. Schema validation is available as both a standalone preflight and an import gate, sync review now has an interactive control point before apply, and live dashboard inspection has a parallel scan path with operator-visible progress.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Rust Dashboard Governance Gate Command
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/governance_gate.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection already emitted stronger governance JSON, including dashboard-level and datasource-level rollups, but Rust still had no local governance-gate command. Teams had to leave the Rust CLI and use the external Python checker even for the simplest query-count and warning-escalation policy checks.
- Current Update: Added a new Rust `dashboard governance-gate` subcommand that reads `--policy`, `--governance`, and `--queries` JSON files and evaluates the first useful policy slice directly inside Rust: `datasources.allowedFamilies`, `datasources.allowedUids`, `datasources.forbidUnknown`, `datasources.forbidMixedFamilies`, `routing.allowedFolderPrefixes`, `queries.maxQueriesPerDashboard`, `queries.maxQueriesPerPanel`, `queries.maxQueryComplexityScore`, `queries.maxDashboardComplexityScore`, `queries.forbidSelectStar`, `queries.requireSqlTimeFilter`, `queries.forbidBroadLokiRegex`, and `enforcement.failOnWarnings`. The command supports `--output-format text|json` plus `--json-output` for normalized artifact writing, and returns a nonzero error when violations exist or warnings are escalated.
- Result: Rust now has its own first-pass governance gate built on top of the existing governance/report artifacts. The CLI still keeps policy evaluation separate from inspection, but operators no longer need Python just to enforce the basic datasource allowlist, folder-routing, mixed-family, unknown-datasource, query-count, query-complexity, dashboard-complexity, SQL/Loki query hygiene, and warning-escalation contract.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Expand Rust Dashboard Governance Gate Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection already emitted governance-oriented JSON and table reports, but downstream gate consumers still had to reconstruct dashboard-level risk rollups from flat `riskRecords`, and governance risk metadata was still maintained through stringly lookup logic instead of one explicit registry.
- Current Update: Added a governance risk spec registry and reused it in the Rust governance builder/tests, then expanded the governance contract with `dashboardGovernance` rows and `dashboardRiskCoverageCount`. The new dashboard rollup summarizes datasource families, datasource counts, mixed-datasource status, risk counts, and risk kinds per dashboard, while the text report now prints a dedicated `# Dashboard Governance` section and surfaces dashboard/datasource risk coverage counts in the summary table.
- Result: Rust governance output is now a stronger gate input without embedding team-specific policy in the CLI. External policy checkers can consume stable dashboard-level and datasource-level rollups directly instead of rebuilding them from low-level dependency and risk rows.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Datasource Governance Rollups To Rust Dashboard Inspection
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard governance already exposed family coverage, dashboard dependency rows, datasource coverage rows, datasource edges, and flat risk records, but it still lacked one datasource-level governance surface that answered blast radius and risk concentration directly.
- Current Update: Added a new `datasourceGovernance` rollup to the governance JSON and text report. The new layer aggregates each datasource's dashboard count, panel count, query count, mixed-dashboard involvement, risk count, risk kinds, orphaned state, and dashboard UID blast radius. The governance summary now also exposes `datasourceRiskCoverageCount`, and the text renderer includes a dedicated `# Datasource Governance` section plus summary visibility for datasources with findings.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspection now has a more complete governance model instead of only family rows plus flat risks. Operators can see which datasource objects carry the most governance pressure without reconstructing that view from edges and individual findings.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Wire Non-Rule Alert Artifacts Into Rust Sync Runtime
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs`, `rust/src/sync/preflight.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Rust sync only treated alert rules as first-class sync resources. Contact points, mute timings, policies, and templates were visible in source bundles and bundle preflight, but they did not flow through live fetch, sync planning, preflight, or live apply as real sync resources.
- Current Update: Extended sync resource normalization and bundle extraction to include contact points, mute timings, policies, and templates as alert-plane sync resources. Live fetch now inventories those resources, sync planning now allows prune deletes for contact points, mute timings, and templates while intentionally keeping policy-tree reset unmanaged, preflight marks non-rule alert resources as live-apply eligible, and live apply now supports create/update wiring for all four types plus delete wiring for the three resource-specific endpoints.
- Result: Rust sync now has one broader alert runtime shape instead of stopping at staged bundle metadata for non-rule alert artifacts, with delete ownership still intentionally conservative only for the notification policy tree.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Add Explicit Notification Policy Reset Ownership To Rust Sync
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/workbench.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Rust sync had already promoted notification policies into live fetch, plan, preflight, and apply, but policy-tree delete/reset still stopped at an `unmanaged` plan result. That left the singleton policy tree outside the same reviewed ownership model used by the other alert provisioning resources.
- Current Update: Sync planning now emits `would-delete` for `alert-policy` when prune is requested, and live apply now routes that operation to `DELETE /api/v1/provisioning/policies`. Because that endpoint resets the full notification policy tree, `sync apply --execute-live` refuses the operation unless the reviewed run explicitly passes `--allow-policy-reset`. The apply help, parser, and focused sync tests now pin the new gate.
- Result: Rust sync now has a complete ownership contract for notification policy reset: plans can represent the operation, reviewed apply can block it by default, and operators must opt in explicitly before a live tree reset is allowed.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Flag Broad Loki Selectors In Dashboard Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Governance already flags empty analyses, mixed dashboards, orphaned datasources, and unknown datasource families, but it still does not call out obviously broad Loki stream selectors that can drive expensive scans.
- Current Update: Added a narrow Loki governance rule that flags broad selectors such as `{}` and regex-only wildcard selectors before downstream line filters or aggregations. The rule stays inside the existing governance risk contract and is pinned by a focused regression.
- Result: Rust governance now surfaces one more cost-oriented Loki risk without changing the query-report schema or analyzer family routing.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Gate Sync Apply On Blocked Bundle Alert Artifacts
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Bundle preflight already surfaced blocked non-rule alert artifacts through `alertArtifactAssessment`, but `sync apply` still only gated on sync/provider blocking counts and could ignore blocked alert artifact review findings.
- Current Update: Taught bundle-preflight validation to include `alertArtifactAssessment.summary.blockedCount` in apply gating, bridged that count into the attached apply-intent summary, and widened the text renderer plus focused CLI tests to show and enforce the new count.
- Result: Rust `sync apply` now respects blocked bundle-level alert artifact findings instead of treating them as advisory-only metadata.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Surface Non-Rule Alert Artifact Counts In Sync Apply Summary
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The apply-intent bridge now blocked on non-rule alert artifacts, but the rendered bundle-preflight summary only exposed the blocking total and hid the remaining plan-only artifact counts.
- Current Update: Carried alert-artifact total and plan-only counts through the bridged apply summary and printed them alongside the blocking count in `sync apply` text output.
- Result: Rust sync apply now reflects the full non-rule alert artifact surface in its staged summary, which makes the remaining contact-point plan-only cases visible without changing live wiring.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Surface Family-Level Orphaned Datasources In Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Governance output already flagged orphaned datasources in the summary and risk rows, but the family coverage table still only showed query-derived counts, which made orphan-only families harder to spot at a glance.
- Current Update: Added an `orphanedDatasourceCount` field to the family coverage rows and table output, and taught the coverage builder to include orphan-only families from inventory so their family rows stay visible even when no queries reference them.
- Result: Rust dashboard governance now exposes orphan pressure directly in the family coverage surface, which makes unused family cleanup easier without changing the broader report schema.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Stage Non-Rule Alert Artifact Assessment In Sync Bundle Preflight
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/bundle_preflight.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Sync bundle preflight already kept rule-level alert checks separate from the main sync plan, but contact points, mute timings, policies, and templates were still only represented indirectly through the broader source-bundle alert contract.
- Current Update: Added a staged alert-artifact assessment to the sync bundle preflight document so non-rule alert export sections now surface explicit counts and per-artifact checks without broadening live wiring. The new assessment keeps contact points plan-only while classifying mute timings, policies, and templates as blocked for review.
- Result: Sync bundle preflight now exposes the remaining non-rule alert artifact surface in a focused, additive way that is easy to test and leaves the existing sync plan checks intact.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Extract Rust Dashboard Dependency Query Parsing Module
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_inspection_dependency_contract.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspection_query_features.rs`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dependency contract still owned the family-specific query parsing helpers inline, so parser logic, contract assembly, and regex-heavy extraction lived in one large module.
- Current Update: Split the family-specific parser helpers into `rust/src/dashboard_inspection_query_features.rs`, kept the dependency contract on assembly/serialization, and wired the contract file through the new small internal interface. Tightened Loki text analysis at the same layer so negative line filters (`!=`, `!~`) are captured without misreading selector matchers inside `{...}`.
- Result: Rust dashboard dependency parsing now has a smaller reusable module boundary plus more complete Loki filter hint extraction, and the focused dependency-contract/shared-fixture regressions pass.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Extend Rust Dashboard Typed Datasource Reference Parsing
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection already parsed typed datasource objects through a narrow stable path, but `pluginId`-only datasource objects still fell through that path and could miss family routing when they were the only explicit type signal.
- Current Update: Extended the internal datasource-reference parser so `pluginId` now participates in the stable summary/type lookup path alongside `uid`, `name`, and `type`. Added a focused resolver regression that routes a `grafana-postgresql-datasource` plugin-id reference into the SQL family without changing the surrounding inspection contract.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspection now covers one more typed datasource-reference shape while keeping the existing output schema and raw panel-key behavior intact.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Expand Rust Dashboard Governance With Dashboard-To-Datasource Edges
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Governance output already exposed dashboard-level rollups and datasource-level blast radius, but it still lacked a direct dashboard-to-datasource governance surface and could misclassify functions-only rows as empty analysis.
- Current Update: Added `dashboardDatasourceEdges` to the governance document and table output, including per-dashboard/per-datasource panel counts, query counts, query fields, and rolled-up metrics/functions/measurements/buckets. Tightened empty-analysis risk detection so function-only rows no longer trigger the warning.
- Result: Rust governance now exposes a broader datasource-usage governance view without changing the existing report families or dependency row schema, and the new edge surface is covered by focused governance tests.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Optimize Rust Dashboard Import Action Resolution With Summary Cache
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import dry-run and update paths still issued `GET /api/dashboards/uid/{uid}` for most files to determine existence and folder path, creating duplicate round-trips on large imports and preventing clean `update_existing_only` skips without per-dashboard fetches.
- Current Update: Added a summary-cache seam in `dashboard/import.rs` that preloads `/api/search` once per import run and reuses it for existence checks and summary `folderUid` lookups. Updated import and dry-run tests so action/path selection now validates cache-backed behavior, including missing-dashboard short-circuit, summary-folder fallback, and `update_existing_only` call reduction.
- Result: Rust import dry-run and live decision paths now avoid unnecessary dashboard detail fetches, keep existing create/update semantics intact, and preserve action behavior for missing/existing checks while reducing redundant round-trips on large import sets.

## 2026-03-23 - Task: Expand Rust Dashboard Dependency Features By Family
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_inspection_dependency_contract.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Dependency-query parsing in Rust still relied on a coarse fallback path for many datasource families, with incomplete Loki/Flux/SQL extraction and limited shape hints for governance/report consumers.
- Current Update: Reworked dependency contract parsing to dispatch by datasource family (Prometheus/Loki/Flux/SQL) and added richer extraction for Loki selectors/matchers/filters/range, Flux pipeline functions/buckets/source references, and SQL shape/source hints. Kept unknown-source fallback conservative and merged extracted hints with legacy `analysis` hints in the existing document shape.
- Result: Rust offline dependency contracts now emit fuller family-specific query hints without changing public report schema, and focused dependency tests now cover Loki selector/function/filter/quote-safe behavior and SQL shape/source extraction.

## 2026-03-22 - Task: Start Typed Rust Dashboard Datasource Reference Parsing
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection still unpacked datasource `uid`/`name`/`type` object fields by hand in several helpers, which made the stable datasource-reference shape easy to duplicate and drift.
- Current Update: Added an internal typed datasource-reference model in `inspect.rs`, routed the stable name/uid/type/inventory lookups through it, and kept the raw panel-key path separate so placeholder datasource labels still count exactly as before. Added a focused regression for name-only object references falling back to the panel datasource UID and inventory-backed metadata.
- Result: Dashboard datasource-reference handling is now partially typed on the stable object path, with external behavior preserved and one lower-risk seam ready for further refactors.

## 2026-03-22 - Task: Route Datasource-Less Search Queries Into The Search Analyzer
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_analyzer_search.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection already routed explicit search datasources into the search analyzer, but datasource-less Lucene/OpenSearch-style queries still fell through to the generic fallback path unless a datasource type happened to be present.
- Current Update: Added a conservative search-signature detector for explicit `_exists_:` and field-clause queries, wired the router to use it, and kept tracing field names out of that search heuristic so trace-only queries still fail closed. Updated the shared analyzer fixture with a datasource-less search case and tightened the resolver test to cover both the new search routing and the tracing exclusion.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspection now classifies obvious search-family query text more consistently, which reduces generic fallback for a supported family without widening the analyzer beyond explicit field hints.

## 2026-03-22 - Task: Clarify Rust Dashboard Dependency Blast Radius Counts
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_inspection_dependency_contract.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard dependency output already showed per-datasource query facts, but the operator-facing dependency summary still conflated dashboard blast radius with query-row totals and did not expose a panel-level count.
- Current Update: Deduped the dependency contract `dashboardCount` by dashboard UID, added a new `panelCount` summary for unique panels, and surfaced the same `panelCount` on each `datasourceUsage` row. Added a focused Rust regression that proves repeated queries on one datasource are counted as one dashboard and one panel per unique scope, while still preserving the existing query total.
- Result: Rust dashboard dependency output now gives operators a clearer blast-radius summary from already-extracted facts without changing the cloud datasource scope.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Conservative Flux Window Bucket Extraction
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_analyzer_flux.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Flux inspection already tracked datasource buckets plus InfluxQL-style time windows, but it did not retain explicit `every:` durations from Flux window pipelines such as `aggregateWindow(every: 5m, ...)`.
- Current Update: Added a narrow Flux-only bucket extractor that records concrete `every:` durations from Flux pipelines while ignoring quoted text, then updated the shared analyzer fixture and the core-family query-row contract to expect the extra `5m` hint alongside the datasource bucket.
- Result: Flux query inspection now carries one more stable, family-specific bucket hint without broadening the analyzer beyond the existing conservative contract.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Dashboard Dependency Count Fields In Rust Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust governance already showed per-dashboard datasource and family lists, but operators still had to count those lists by hand to judge dependency blast radius.
- Current Update: Added explicit `datasourceCount` and `datasourceFamilyCount` fields to each dashboard dependency row and surfaced those counts in the governance table output.
- Result: Rust dashboard governance now exposes explicit dependency counts alongside the datasource and family lists, which makes dashboard blast-radius review faster without changing scope.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Surface Datasource Blast Radius In Rust Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard governance already rolled up dashboard-level query facts, but the datasource section still only showed counts. Operators could not see the actual dashboard UID blast radius from the existing report rows without cross-referencing elsewhere.
- Current Update: Added `dashboardUids` to each datasource coverage row, surfaced panel counts and dashboard UID lists in the governance datasource table, and widened the governance summary table to include mixed-dashboard and orphaned-datasource counts.
- Result: Rust dashboard governance now exposes a clearer datasource-to-dashboard blast-radius surface from already-extracted facts while staying out of cloud datasource scope.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Canonicalize Rust Dashboard Datasource-Type Family Routing
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard family resolution already preferred datasource types over query shape when the type was recognized, but Grafana plugin names that still carried `grafana-...-datasource` wrappers could fall through to generic query-shape fallback instead of landing in the supported family contract.
- Current Update: Canonicalized datasource-type routing so wrapped Grafana plugin names collapse to the same family labels as the existing core aliases, then added a SQL fixture case that proves `grafana-postgresql-datasource` no longer falls back to generic metric scraping for an `up` query.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspection now routes more datasource-type-driven queries directly into the supported family analyzers and relies less on the generic fallback path for core SQL inspection.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Roll Up Rust Dashboard Dependency Analysis In Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard governance rows summarized datasource names, families, panel counts, and query counts, but the extracted query facts that drive operator review stayed split across the flat per-query report rows.
- Current Update: Added dashboard-level rollups for `queryFields`, `metrics`, `functions`, `measurements`, and `buckets` in the governance dependency rows and widened the governance table output to show the same facts. Tightened the Rust governance tests to pin the new rollup shape and aligned the Loki line-filter expectations with the current analyzer output.
- Result: Rust dashboard governance now exposes a clearer, operator-facing dependency summary from the existing analyzer facts without expanding into cloud datasource coverage.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Loki Line Filter Extraction
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_analyzer_loki.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Loki dashboard analyzer already kept family routing conservative, but it only surfaced generic line-filter hints for `|=` / `|~` stages and did not retain the literal filter text. That left Loki inspection thinner than the other core families even though the query text already contained stable, obvious filter literals.
- Current Update: Added a narrow Loki line-filter scanner that records both the existing generic hint and a literal-specific marker for obvious `|=` and `|~` stages while preserving the current stream-selector/label-matcher contract. The scanner stays quote-aware so `line_format` template strings are ignored instead of being misread as selectors or filters, and the shared fixture plus focused Rust tests now cover the richer Loki output.
- Result: Rust dashboard inspection now exposes more useful Loki filter signal without widening the analyzer beyond the current conservative family-routing contract.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Broaden Rust Sync Contract Gates And Sync-Only Live Entry Point
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/sync_source_bundle_contract_cases.json`, `fixtures/alert_export_contract_cases.json`, `fixtures/alert_recreate_contract_cases.json`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-sync-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting had become denser and the full Rust live smoke was green again, but the broader sync surface still lacked one explicit cross-domain source-bundle contract and one narrower sync-only live entrypoint. `sync` help-full examples also still emphasized only summary/plan/review/apply, while `bundle` and `bundle-preflight` remained underrepresented in top-level sync/operator discovery.
- Current Update: Added a checked-in cross-domain sync source-bundle contract fixture, upgraded sync bundle tests to assert stable dashboard/datasource/folder/alerting summary/text output, moved more alert replay expectations into shared fixtures, added `make quality-sync-rust`, added `scripts/test-rust-sync-live-grafana.sh` plus `make test-sync-live`, and expanded sync root/help-full examples so `bundle` and `bundle-preflight` are part of the stable operator-facing surface.
- Result: Rust sync now has a clearer domain-level quality gate, a focused Docker live entrypoint, broader source-bundle contract coverage across domains, and a more accurate operator help surface for bundle-oriented workflows.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Fix Rust Alert Replay Live Rule Seed And Template Drift Parity
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The expanded Rust alert replay live smoke had a real gap between focused runtime coverage and live Grafana behavior. The new alert rule seed payload was too minimal for Grafana `12.4.1` provisioning, template replay left one persistent diff because live template versions drifted after update, and the full Rust live smoke still assumed the sync smoke fixture had zero alert rules even though the new alert replay seed now provisions one.
- Current Update: Reworked the alert replay seed to create a dedicated alert folder and provision the smoke alert rule with a fuller Grafana-compatible payload shape. Normalized Rust template compare/export/import handling to strip template `version` as a server-managed field, aligned the recreate matrix expectation with that normalization, and updated the full sync smoke assertion so the combined Rust live gate expects the seeded `cpu-high` alert rule in the sync source bundle instead of rejecting it.
- Result: The alert replay split smoke, alert artifact split smoke, `quality-alert-rust`, and the full Rust Docker live smoke now all pass together against Grafana `12.4.1`, and the new alert replay fixture is consistent across focused tests, scoped alert live gates, and the full sync/live path.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Expand Rust Alert Recreate Matrix And Split Alert Live Artifact Replay Gates
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-alert-artifact-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-alert-replay-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting had one focused contact-point recreate regression and one combined alert-only Docker smoke, but the recreate runtime contract still did not cover rules, mute timings, templates, or policies, and the live alert path was still effectively one combined artifact+replay stage. Sync tests also knew about non-rule alert artifacts only at the narrow contact-point/policies fallback edge, not as one broader replay-artifact surface.
- Current Update: Generalized the test-only alert request seam so focused runtime tests can cover rule/contact-point/mute-timing/template recreate decisions plus policies update-only parity through the same helper path. Replaced the single contact-point recreate unit coverage with a broader recreate matrix, added sync focused regressions that preserve non-rule alert replay artifact summary/path data while still ignoring those items as top-level bundle-preflight resources, and split the Docker alert-only smoke into explicit artifact and replay scopes with standalone wrapper scripts and Make targets.
- Result: Rust alerting now has one broader recreate matrix contract, sync is more explicit about alert replay artifacts vs sync resources, and maintainers can run alert artifact or alert replay live smoke independently instead of treating alert-only validation as one opaque stage.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Focused Rust Alert Recreate Runtime Regressions
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting already had a stronger replay line and Docker live smoke that covered contact-point delete/recreate, but that recreate path still lived only in the live gate. There was no focused Rust runtime regression proving the import logic prefers create over update when a previously exported contact-point UID disappears remotely, or that the replay returns to same-state after recreate.
- Current Update: Added a minimal test-only alert request seam for contact-point compare/import helpers and two stateful Rust regressions that drive the missing-remote recreate path without Docker. The new tests prove the recreate flow transitions from `missing-remote` to `would-create` to same-state, and they explicitly lock that replay does not try a `PUT` update when the remote UID is gone.
- Result: The highest-value live-only alert recreate behavior now has focused Rust runtime coverage, so regressions in the contact-point recreate decision path should surface before Docker smoke.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Expand Rust Alert Contract Surface And Split Alert-Only Live Gate
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/alert_export_contract_cases.json`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_list.rs`, `rust/src/sync/bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-alert-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting already had structured import/diff JSON and broader live replay coverage, but the surrounding contract surface still had several shallow spots. Alert export artifact shape was only asserted in hand-written tests, list/export parity only covered contact points, sync bundle-preflight still lacked a focused regression around non-rule raw alert artifacts, and `make test-alert-live` was still just an alias for the full Rust smoke.
- Current Update: Added a checked-in alert export contract fixture and focused regressions for root index/resource-subdir parity, mute-timing/template/rule list-export identity parity, and diff/import action correspondence for update vs recreate semantics. Added a sync bundle-preflight regression proving non-rule raw alert export artifacts do not incorrectly become top-level sync resources, strengthened unified help-full coverage for the new alert JSON examples, and split the live smoke into a true alert-only path via `scripts/test-rust-alert-live-grafana.sh` plus `RUST_LIVE_SCOPE=alert`.
- Result: Rust alerting now has a denser focused contract layer around artifacts, list/export parity, and sync fallback behavior, and maintainers can run an actual alert-only Docker smoke instead of always paying for the full Rust live gate.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Alert And Sync Artifact Contracts
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert_list.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `Makefile`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting already had its first structured dry-run import preview and a stronger live replay path, but the surrounding contracts were still looser than the other main Rust domains. `alert diff` remained text-only, alert export/list identity parity was not pinned in focused tests, sync bundle tests did not explicitly prove that alert export artifact metadata survived into the bundled `alerting` section, and there was no narrower Rust quality entrypoint for alert-only iteration.
- Current Update: Added `alert diff --json` with a structured `summary + rows` document and matching parser/help/helper tests, plus a focused contact-point list/export identity parity regression. Added a sync CLI regression that verifies the source bundle preserves alert export artifact summary counts, export metadata, and `sourcePath` entries for contact points and policies. Updated the Rust alert help examples, the user guides, and the Makefile with narrower `quality-alert-rust` and `test-alert-live` entrypoints.
- Result: Rust alerting now has a more coherent operator contract across export/list/diff/import/sync, and maintainers have a focused alert-only quality gate in addition to the full Rust suite and Docker smoke.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Rust Alert Replay And Dry-Run Json Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust alerting already supported export/import/diff and the Docker smoke covered a basic export -> local drift -> dry-run -> update replay flow, but the operator-facing preview still only existed as line-oriented text and the live gate did not validate alert export artifact indexes or recreate a missing remote resource from the exported bundle.
- Current Update: Added `alert import --dry-run --json` in Rust with a structured `summary + rows` document for dry-run import actions, plus focused parser/help/helper regressions that lock the new JSON contract. Extended the Rust Docker alert smoke with artifact sanity checks for the export root index, contact-point index, and notification-policies document; switched dry-run validation to structured JSON; and added a delete/recreate replay path that removes the exported contact point, verifies `Diff missing-remote`, previews `would-create`, and re-imports the bundle back to same-state.
- Result: Rust alerting now has a clearer replay contract: artifact sanity, structured dry-run preview, update replay, missing-remote detection, and recreate import are all covered end to end in the Docker live gate.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Rust Access Live Artifact Sanity Gate
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access already had replay-heavy Docker live coverage and focused Rust bundle-contract tests, but the live smoke itself only checked that the exported files existed and could be replayed. It did not yet validate that user, team, org, and service-account exports wrote bundle and `export-metadata.json` artifacts that still matched the checked-in access bundle contract.
- Current Update: Added a shared access export metadata helper to the Rust Docker smoke and switched all four access export paths to validate bundle filename, bundle `kind`, bundle `version`, minimum record count, metadata `kind`, metadata `version`, metadata `recordCount`, `sourceUrl`, and `sourceDir` before continuing into replay and diff checks. Updated the maintainer note so the access live gate description now explicitly includes artifact metadata sanity checks.
- Result: Rust access live smoke now verifies artifact contract plus replay flow together, so bundle metadata drift surfaces in the Docker gate instead of only in focused Rust unit tests.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Access Artifact Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/access_bundle_contract_cases.json`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access replay coverage had grown substantially, but the access bundle artifacts themselves still did not have one broader contract layer that pinned `kind`, `version`, metadata `recordCount`, and import rejection of mismatched `kind` or future `version` consistently across user, team, org, and service-account.
- Current Update: Added focused Rust bundle-contract regressions that verify each access export writes the expected bundle and `export-metadata.json` shape, including stable `kind`, `version`, `recordCount`, `sourceUrl`, and `sourceDir` where applicable. Added matching import-side regressions that prove user, team, org, and service-account all fail closed on bundle kind mismatch and future bundle version instead of silently accepting drifted artifacts.
- Result: Rust access artifacts now have a clearer contract layer above replay coverage, and the focused plus grouped Rust access tests passed after tightening the bundle/metadata assertions.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Rust User Structured Dry-Run Parity
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/mod.rs`, `rust/src/access/user.rs`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust user replay now covered both global and org scopes, but the operator-facing dry-run preview still lagged behind team and service-account. `access user import --dry-run --json` only emitted a bare row array with no structured summary, and the Docker live smoke still verified user dry-run behavior with grep against text output instead of one stable JSON contract.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated Rust helper for user dry-run JSON documents and switched `access user import --dry-run --json` to emit `summary + rows` like the team surface. Added focused helper coverage for the summary document and revalidated the broader `user_` suite. Updated the Rust Docker smoke so both global and org-scoped user replay flows now validate structured dry-run JSON instead of plain-text grep, while still allowing full exported bundles to carry more than one user record.
- Result: Rust user replay now exposes a stable structured dry-run JSON contract across both scopes, and the full Rust Docker live smoke passed against Grafana `12.4.1` after aligning the live assertions with bundle-wide preview semantics.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Access User Org-Scope Replay Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/user.rs`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access user already had a global replay contract, but the org-scoped half still stopped short of a real replay line. There was no focused contract for org-role plus team-membership replay, no guard proving `--yes` blocks team-removal mutations before they start, and the Docker live smoke still skipped org-scoped user export/diff/import replay entirely.
- Current Update: Added focused Rust regressions for org-scoped user export with teams, same-state org diff with teams, `--yes` enforcement before team-removal replay, dry-run preview of org-role plus team drift, and live replay of org-role plus team-membership changes. Extended the Rust Docker smoke with a dedicated org-scoped user replay section that exports one real org bundle with teams, mutates `orgRole` plus the team set, verifies changed-state diff, previews add/remove team actions in dry-run import, replays it live, and confirms same-state diff after replay. Tightening this path also exposed one runtime issue: org-scoped import used to apply earlier mutations before failing on missing `--yes` for team removals. The runtime now computes the removal set first and fails closed before any live mutation.
- Result: Org-scoped user replay is now locked through focused tests plus Docker live smoke, and the full Rust live gate passed against Grafana `12.4.1` after isolating the adjacent replay-team bundle to keep the broader access smoke deterministic.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Access User Export Diff Import Replay Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/mod.rs`, `rust/src/access/user.rs`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access user already supported export, diff, and import in both global and org scopes, but it did not yet have a service-account-style replay contract. The focused suite did not lock global export -> diff -> dry-run import -> live import -> delete -> recreate behavior, and the Docker live smoke still stopped at add/list/delete checks instead of replaying a real exported user bundle.
- Current Update: Added focused Rust regressions for global user export bundle writes, same-state diff, dry-run preview for profile plus Grafana-admin drift, live replay update of an existing global user, and recreate import of a missing global user when the bundle carries a password. Extended the Rust Docker smoke with a dedicated global user replay section that exports a real user bundle, mutates stable global-surface fields (`name`, `grafanaAdmin`, and recreate-only `password`), checks same/different diff states, previews dry-run import, replays it live, deletes the replay user, and recreates it from the same bundle. Live validation also exposed a real runtime bug: existing-user replay was sending a partial profile payload to `PUT /api/users/{id}`, which Grafana `12.4.1` rejects. The runtime now sends a merged full `login`/`email`/`name` payload when any profile field changes.
- Result: User runtime/tests are validated and the full Rust Docker live smoke passed against Grafana `12.4.1` after aligning the replay gate with the true global-user diff surface and fixing the full-profile update payload requirement.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Access Org Export Diff Import Replay Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access/mod.rs`, `rust/src/access/org.rs`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access org already supported list/add/modify/delete/export/import, but it did not have an org diff command, focused replay coverage for exported org users, or a Docker live smoke path that exercised org export -> diff -> import replay end to end.
- Current Update: Added the org diff command and the supporting diff runtime, plus focused tests for same-state diff, user-role drift, dry-run preview, existing-org replay update, and missing-org create replay. The Rust live smoke now exports the full org bundle with users so diff stays truthful against global live state, mutates one replay-org user role, verifies same/different diff states, previews the additive org-user dry-run shape the runtime currently emits, replays it live, recreates the deleted replay org from the same bundle, and then deletes that temporary org again so later all-org dashboard smoke is not contaminated.
- Result: Org runtime/tests are validated and the full Rust Docker live smoke passed against Grafana `12.4.1` after aligning the org replay path to the global org diff contract.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Access Team Replay Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/team.rs`, `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust access team already supported export, diff, import, and live CRUD/membership flows, but the contract stopped short of a service-account-style replay gate. Dry-run JSON output was not structured like service-account, and the live smoke did not prove export -> diff same -> mutate bundle -> diff changed -> dry-run preview -> live replay -> diff same -> delete -> recreate import for a real team bundle.
- Current Update: Added a structured dry-run JSON document helper for team import, added focused Rust regressions for team export with members/admins, same-state diff, membership-drift diff, and structured dry-run preview, and extended the Rust Docker live smoke with a dedicated replay team flow that exports a real team bundle, mutates its membership payload, previews the structured dry-run JSON, replays it live, deletes the replay team, and recreates it from the same exported bundle. The live smoke intentionally avoids exact team diff assertions on the freshly exported bundle because Grafana's live team membership surface is not stable enough there, while the Rust unit tests still lock the team diff contract directly.
- Result: Team runtime/tests are validated and the full Rust Docker live smoke passed against Grafana `12.4.1` using the stable replay-only live contract for team bundles.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard All-Orgs Import Preflight Routing Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had single-org import dependency preflight plus combined export-root routing and round-trip coverage, but it did not yet prove that `--use-export-org` applies dependency preflight per routed org scope, stops on a failing scoped preflight, and completely skips unselected org scopes under `--only-org-id`.
- Current Update: Added focused Rust regressions that seed a two-org combined export root, route it through `import_dashboards_by_export_org_with_request(...)`, and then run real scoped imports with per-org live datasource/plugin inventories. One regression confirms the first scoped import can succeed while a later org is blocked by preflight before POST. The other confirms `--only-org-id` prevents any preflight or import attempt for unselected exported org scopes.
- Result: The all-org import path is now pinned through org-scoped dependency preflight and stop/skip semantics instead of relying only on single-org preflight tests plus general routing coverage.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard All-Orgs Routed Import Failure Reporting
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already stopped routed `--use-export-org` imports on the first failing scoped import, but the propagated error text only reflected the inner failure. Operators could not tell which exported org scope, target org, or raw import directory failed without rerunning with extra context.
- Current Update: Wrapped routed import failures with explicit source-org / target-org / import-dir context in `import_dashboards_by_export_org_with_request(...)`, and tightened the main scoped-preflight regression into a three-org fail-fast case so it now proves the first failing scoped import surfaces the routed-org context and prevents any later org scope from running.
- Result: Multi-org routed dashboard import failures now report the failing exported org and scoped raw path directly, while the Rust suite locks the fail-fast behavior as part of the all-org contract.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Align Rust Routed Import Dry-Run And Live Failure Scope Identity
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Routed dry-run JSON already exposed stable scope identity fields like `sourceOrgId`, `sourceOrgName`, `orgAction`, `targetOrgId`, and `importDir`, but the live routed-import output built its own freeform status/error text separately. That left room for dry-run and live failure surfaces to drift even when they referred to the same routed org scope.
- Current Update: Added a shared formatter for routed import scope identity in the Rust import path and used it for the live progress line plus routed failure wrapping. Added a focused regression that compares the dry-run routed preview entries for one exported org scope with the corresponding live routed failure string and locks the shared identifiers across both surfaces.
- Result: Dry-run preview and live routed failure reporting now speak about the same exported org scope with the same stable identity fields, which tightens the operator-facing `--use-export-org` contract beyond simple success/failure coverage.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Align Rust Routed Import Table Json And Progress Scope Labels
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust routed import already exposed stable scope identity in dry-run JSON and used the same wording for live routed failures, but the table surface and live progress line still had their own target-org label handling. In particular, missing target orgs showed `<new>` in the table while live progress used `-`.
- Current Update: Promoted the routed target-org label formatting into a shared helper and reused it from both the routed-org table and the live progress/failure summary path. Added a focused regression that builds a routed dry-run JSON preview, renders the routed org table, and checks both against the shared routed progress summary format for existing and would-create org scopes.
- Result: Routed import table, dry-run JSON, and live progress/failure wording now share the same scope vocabulary, including a consistent `<new>` label for missing target orgs.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Routed Import Selected-Scope Status Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had focused routed-import parity checks for existing and would-create scopes plus separate coverage for `--only-org-id`, but it did not yet lock a broader selected-scope contract that covered filtered export scopes, mixed `exists`/`missing` org actions, summary counts, table rows, and shared scope-summary wording in one place.
- Current Update: Added one larger routed dry-run regression that seeds three exported org scopes, filters down to two with `--only-org-id`, and verifies the selected routed scopes produce consistent `exists`/`missing` status across JSON summary counts, routed org rows, rendered table labels, and the shared scope-summary formatter. The unselected exported org is explicitly checked to stay out of the routed dry-run payload.
- Result: The Rust routed-import contract now pins selected-scope filtering and mixed routed-org statuses as one broader operator-facing surface instead of a few narrower spot checks.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Align Rust Routed Would-Create And Created Org Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had separate coverage for dry-run `would-create` preview and live `created` org creation under `--use-export-org`, but the two paths were not locked together as one contract. That left room for the exported-org identity, import-dir continuity, or create-missing-org semantics to drift between dry-run and live mutation.
- Current Update: Added a focused parity regression that uses the same exported org scope to compare dry-run `would-create` routed preview with live `created` org import routing. The test checks dry-run `orgAction`/`targetOrgId` semantics, verifies the live path issues `POST /api/orgs` and routes the scoped import to the newly created org ID, and confirms both paths preserve the same exported org identity and raw import directory.
- Result: The Rust routed-import contract now explicitly ties together dry-run org creation preview and live org creation routing for `--create-missing-orgs`.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Rust Routed Import Status Matrix Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had parity checks for selected routed-import statuses, but they were still spread across separate regressions for `exists`/`missing`, `would-create`, and `created`. There was not yet one focused test that pinned the full org-level status matrix and the corresponding `targetOrgId` semantics in one place.
- Current Update: Added a matrix regression that reuses the same exported org scopes to compare dry-run `missing` and `would-create` payloads with the live `created` routing path, while keeping an `exists` org in the same matrix. The test now checks summary counts, `orgAction`, `targetOrgId`, and shared scope-summary wording for all four statuses together.
- Result: Rust `--use-export-org` now has one broader org-status matrix contract covering `exists`, `missing`, `would-create`, and `created`.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Rust Datasource Routed Import Status Matrix And Live Gate
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust datasource routed import already supported `--use-export-org` and `--create-missing-orgs`, but its status semantics were not pinned to the same depth as dashboard. Table/live wording still used a different missing-target label, unit coverage lacked a broader status matrix contract, and the Docker live smoke only asserted coarse existing/would-create behavior.
- Current Update: Added shared routed datasource scope formatters in the Rust runtime so table/progress/failure wording uses one scope vocabulary and a consistent `<new>` target-org label. Added focused datasource contract tests for scope-identity parity and the org-level status matrix covering `exists`, `missing`, `would-create`, and `created`. Extended the Rust Docker smoke so datasource routed import now asserts selected-org filtering plus the existing/missing/would-create matrix before verifying the live recreated-org import.
- Result: Datasource routed import now matches dashboard on contract depth: unit parity, broader status-matrix coverage, and Docker-backed live validation all cover the same operator-facing org-status surface.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Validate Rust Dashboard Routed Import Status Matrix In Live Smoke
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust Docker smoke already covered routed dashboard import at a coarse level, but it only checked one selected existing-org preview, one `would-create` preview, and the final missing-org recreate/import. It did not yet validate the full routed status matrix or assert the summary and `targetOrgId` semantics for `exists`, `missing`, and `would-create` in live-smoke form.
- Current Update: Extended the dashboard live smoke to assert the routed `--use-export-org` status matrix end to end: selected existing-org dry-run preview, missing-org dry-run preview after deleting the target org, `--create-missing-orgs --dry-run` `would-create` preview, and the final live recreate/import path. The smoke now checks summary counts, selected-org filtering, `orgAction`, and `targetOrgId` semantics in the routed dry-run JSON before verifying the recreated org and restored dashboard.
- Result: The Rust Docker gate now exercises the routed dashboard import status matrix, so the contract is verified not only in unit tests but also against a live Grafana 12.4.1 container.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard All-Orgs Import Diff Round-Trip Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had combined export-root inspection parity and `--use-export-org` routing coverage, but it did not yet prove that one combined `export --all-orgs` root could be routed into org-scoped imports and then diff cleanly against the per-org live state.
- Current Update: Added a focused Rust round-trip regression that seeds a two-org combined export root, routes it through `import_dashboards_by_export_org_with_request(...)`, performs real scoped imports through `import_dashboards_with_request(...)`, captures the resulting per-org stored dashboard payloads, and then runs `diff_dashboards_with_request(...)` against each routed raw scope with the matching destination folder context.
- Result: The all-org import/export path is now pinned through org routing, scoped mutation, and scoped diff instead of stopping at dry-run routing or inspect-only parity.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard Multi-Org Dependency Json Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The merged multi-org inspect-export / inspect-live path already had broad report and governance parity coverage, but the `dependency-json` artifact still lacked a focused contract check for its stable top-level shape and row usage/orphaned semantics.
- Current Update: Tightened the existing multi-org inspection regression so it now also checks the `dependency-json` contract from a combined export root, including the stable `kind`, summary counts, per-query stable fields, datasource usage query fields, and orphaned datasource count.
- Result: The merged multi-org dependency artifact is now pinned by a focused Rust contract test instead of relying only on broad document equality.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Validate Rust Dashboard Inspect Export Vs Live Parity In Live Smoke
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust live smoke already exercised `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` against the same seeded Grafana instance, but it only checked for coarse family coverage and governance presence. It did not compare the normalized operator-facing report/governance projections across the two paths.
- Current Update: Added normalized projection helpers to the Rust live smoke so `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` can be compared on stable report/governance fields without depending on file paths or array ordering. Kept the coarse family-coverage assertions in place so the gate still reads clearly to operators.
- Result: The Rust live smoke now validates projected report/governance parity instead of full-document equality, which keeps the maintainer gate stable while still surfacing operator-visible inspect-export vs inspect-live drift.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Restore Rust All-Orgs Dashboard Root Export Bundle In Org-Client Mode
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/export.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard export already wrote the aggregate root `index.json` and `export-metadata.json` when `--all-orgs` ran through the request-injected path, but the real binary path that rebuilds org-scoped HTTP clients did not mirror that behavior. Live multi-org `inspect-export` against the combined dashboard export root therefore skipped the intended merge path and lost per-row `org` / `orgId`.
- Current Update: Moved the aggregate root export write into a shared helper and reused it from both `export_dashboards_with_request(...)` and `export_dashboards_with_org_clients(...)`. The Rust Docker live smoke now reaches the multi-org `inspect-export` root assertion again, and the root export bundle is present in the real CLI path instead of only in unit-tested request injection.
- Result: Rust `dashboard export --all-orgs` now emits the same aggregate root manifest/index in the real org-client path as it does in the injected test path, so multi-org inspection keeps org-scoped rows instead of degrading them to blank org metadata.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard Export Row Core Family Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard export-row coverage was split across several family-specific raw-export tests, which made the current Prometheus, Loki, Flux, SQL, search, and tracing contract harder to reuse and easier to drift.
- Current Update: Consolidated the raw-export query-row coverage into one table-driven inventory-backed fixture that exercises the supported core families with pattern-based Prometheus/Loki/Flux/SQL/search/tracing expectations. The test now checks the shared row contract, datasource inventory fields, folder identity, and render-document summary values from one reusable raw-export fixture.
- Result: Export inspection row coverage now reads as a single reusable core-family contract instead of several one-off family spot checks, while staying aligned with the current analyzer behavior.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Accept Preserved Raw Dashboard Documents In Rust Source Metadata Collection
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/list.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard source-metadata extraction still assumed Grafana-style wrapped payloads with a top-level `dashboard` object. That was fine for live API responses, but Rust raw export intentionally writes preserved web-import dashboard objects without the wrapper, so import-side dependency preflight could fail against its own raw export files with `Unexpected dashboard payload from Grafana.`
- Current Update: Switched `collect_dashboard_source_metadata(...)` to reuse `extract_dashboard_object(...)`, which already accepts either wrapped Grafana payloads or preserved raw dashboard objects. Added a focused Rust regression that feeds the helper a preserved raw document and asserts the datasource names and UIDs are still extracted correctly.
- Result: Rust import/dependency-preflight paths now accept the same raw dashboard document shape that Rust export writes, which closes the self-round-trip contract gap instead of relying on wrapped live payload assumptions.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Expand Rust Dashboard Live Smoke Into Inspect And Governance
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust live smoke already covered dashboard export/import/diff and multi-org replay, but it did not exercise the newer `inspect-export` / `inspect-live` report and governance surfaces against a real Grafana instance. Recent Rust inspection work for Prometheus, Loki, Flux, SQL, search, and tracing was still mostly guarded by unit tests and offline fixtures.
- Current Update: Expanded the Docker-backed Rust smoke fixture with additional Loki, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Tempo datasources plus one mixed core-family dashboard, then added live checks for offline `inspect-export --output-format report-json`, offline `governance-json`, datasource-family filtering, live `inspect-live --output-format report-json`, and live `governance-json`.
- Result: The Rust live smoke now validates the broader operator-facing inspection contract end-to-end, including core-family family labeling and governance output, instead of stopping at export/import mechanics.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard Inspection Core Family Fixture
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The shared Rust dashboard inspection fixture still had thin or ambiguous coverage for the core non-cloud families even though the analyzers already supported Prometheus, Loki, Flux, SQL, search, and tracing.
- Current Update: Expanded the shared contract with representative operator-facing rows for Prometheus histogram quantiles, Loki pipeline stages, Flux aggregateWindow pipelines, SQL CTE/join normalization, the Grafana OpenSearch datasource alias, and tracing `resource.service.name` hints, while keeping the fixture aligned with current analyzer output rather than adding new parsing behavior.
- Result: The shared fixture now pins a clearer family boundary across the core Rust inspection families without changing the analyzer implementation.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Explicit Tracing Inspection Routing
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Tempo, Jaeger, and Zipkin datasource types still dropped into the generic unknown-family fallback during dashboard inspection, so trace-oriented queries had no dedicated routing contract.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated `tracing` inspection family for Tempo/Jaeger/Zipkin aliases and a narrow analyzer that only keeps obvious field-shaped trace hints such as `service.name`, `span.name`, and trace-id fields. The analyzer stays conservative and returns empty analysis for plain text or other non-obvious shapes, and the shared fixture now covers all three datasource aliases.
- Result: Trace datasources now route through an explicit inspection family instead of the unknown fallback, while the analyzer contract remains narrow enough to avoid speculative parsing.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Add Explicit Elasticsearch/OpenSearch Inspection Routing
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_analyzer_search.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust dashboard inspection resolver already classified Prometheus, Loki, Flux, and SQL families, but Elasticsearch/OpenSearch datasource types still fell through to the generic fallback path and were treated as unknown for inspection routing.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated `search` inspection family plus a conservative Elasticsearch/OpenSearch analyzer that extracts Lucene-style field references, skips obvious JSON Query DSL payloads, and now recognizes `@timestamp` field clauses. The relevant datasource aliases route into that family ahead of panel/target/query fallbacks, and the report/filter/governance surfaces now normalize search-family labels consistently. Shared analyzer fixtures and focused Rust tests were expanded to cover analyzer output, export inspection rows, report filtering, and governance grouping.
- Result: Elasticsearch and OpenSearch now follow an explicit inspection routing path instead of relying on unknown-family fallback, their query reports use a consistent `search` family label, and operator-visible report/governance output no longer mixes raw datasource-type labels back in.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Normalize Tracing Inspect Governance Families
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection governance normalized search aliases, but `tempo`, `jaeger`, and `zipkin` still behaved like separate raw datasource labels in family coverage and could fall back to `unknown` when no inventory row was available.
- Current Update: Mapped Tempo/Jaeger/Zipkin into the shared `tracing` family, preserved tracing datasource identity during governance fallback, and added focused Rust regressions for query-report filtering plus governance family grouping across all three tracing plugins.
- Result: Tracing datasource rows now group under one operator-visible family label in query report filters and governance coverage, without changing the existing search family behavior.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Tighten Rust Dashboard Inspection Analyzer Boundaries
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard inspection already had family-specific analyzers, but the family resolver still mixed datasource-type checks and query-shape fallbacks in one block, and there was no focused table-driven coverage for the routing boundary itself.
- Current Update: Split the resolver into explicit datasource-type and query-signature helpers, kept the `resolved_datasource_type` fast path in front of target/panel/query fallbacks, re-exported the inspect family helpers for test visibility, and added table-driven Rust tests that lock alias-to-family mapping, query-signature fallback mapping, and resolver precedence.
- Result: The dashboard inspection boundary is clearer now: datasource-type routing is isolated from query-shape inference, and the precedence rules are pinned by focused Rust tests without touching Python.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Add Rust Dashboard Import Dependency Preflight
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/todo-archive.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard import only validated export metadata, folder layout, and existing dashboard lookup behavior before mutating Grafana. It did not preflight live datasource existence or plugin availability, so a live import could still reach POST even when the imported dashboard clearly referenced missing dependencies.
- Current Update: Added a live-import-only preflight that scans raw dashboard exports for datasource references and panel plugin types, resolves them against live datasource/plugin inventories, and fails closed before any live POST when required datasources or plugins are missing. The dry-run path remains preview-only.
- Result: Rust dashboard import now blocks earlier on missing live datasource/plugin dependencies while preserving dry-run behavior and the existing import flow for dashboards that do not expose dependency signals.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Improve Dashboard Prompt Export Fidelity
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/transformer.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard/prompt.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_prompt_export_cases.json`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/todo-archive.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard prompt export already rewrote datasource references into Grafana-style `__inputs`, but the active backlog still called out two fidelity gaps: datasource labels / datasource `__requires` names still drifted from Grafana external export for some families, and the mixed-type / same-type prompt surface was not locked by one shared cross-runtime contract.
- Current Update: Added a shared prompt-export fixture that both runtimes use to check mixed Prometheus/Loki, same-type PostgreSQL, and mixed OpenSearch/PostgreSQL cases. Tightened Python prompt-export plugin naming for canonical datasource display names such as `OpenSearch`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Microsoft SQL Server`, and taught both runtimes to render Grafana-style panel display names like `Time series` in panel `__requires`.
- Result: Prompt export fidelity for datasource labels, datasource `__requires`, and panel `__requires` is now locked by one broader shared contract, and the backlog can move on from this prompt-export item to the next dashboard/import/inspection tasks.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Reduce Python Dashboard Import Org Lookup Repetition
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`
- Baseline: Python dashboard import already cached per-dashboard and per-folder lookups during one import run, but it still proxied `fetch_current_org()` and `list_orgs()` directly to the underlying client. Multi-org routing and export-org guard paths could therefore reissue the same live org reads within a single import flow.
- Current Update: Extended the Python per-import cached client wrapper to cache current-org and org-list responses alongside the existing dashboard/folder caches, and added focused tests that prove repeated wrapper calls only hit the underlying client once for each org lookup type.
- Result: Python import/dry-run now matches the Rust import path more closely for org-level lookup reuse, trimming repeated live Grafana reads on multi-org and matching-org flows without changing operator-visible behavior.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Dependency Preflight
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/import_runtime.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard/import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Dashboard import only validated export metadata and folder layout before mutating Grafana. It did not preflight live datasource existence or plugin availability across runtimes, and Python/Rust had no checked import-side guard that could stop known-missing dependencies before the write path.
- Current Update: Added import-side dependency preflight in both runtimes before live dashboard mutation. Python scans raw dashboard documents for datasource refs, panel plugin types, and alert/contact references, then checks the live datasource, plugin, and contact-point inventories only when those signals are present. Rust now stages dashboard datasource/plugin dependencies through the existing sync-preflight contract before import write calls and blocks when the staged checks report blocking items.
- Result: Dashboard import now fails earlier on missing live dependencies instead of reaching mutation first. Python covers datasource, plugin, alert datasource, and contact-point references; Rust now covers dashboard datasource/plugin dependencies with checked preflight coverage while preserving dry-run behavior.

## 2026-03-20 - Task: Add Combined Datasource Live Smoke Gate
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-combined-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource live validation existed as two separate Docker smoke entrypoints, one for Rust and one for Python, so maintainers had to run them independently to recheck runtime parity.
- Current Update: Added a combined fail-fast datasource live smoke wrapper and a `make test-datasource-live` shortcut that runs the Rust live smoke first and then the Python datasource live smoke against the same local Docker Grafana instance.
- Result: One command now rechecks datasource runtime behavior across both runtimes, which makes it easier to validate the shared datasource contracts and catch drift without running two separate live smoke commands by hand.

## 2026-03-19 - Task: Add Python Datasource Preset Profiles
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/datasource/catalog.py`, `python/grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, `python/grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`
- Baseline: Python `datasource add` only exposed the legacy `--apply-supported-defaults` switch, which always applied the same starter scaffold for supported types.
- Current Update: Added `--preset-profile starter|full` to Python `datasource add`, kept `--apply-supported-defaults` as the starter-profile alias, and taught the catalog/workflow path to resolve defaults by type plus profile before merging user `--json-data` overrides.
- Result: Operators can now opt into a fuller datasource scaffold when the catalog has one, while the old starter behavior remains unchanged for existing `--apply-supported-defaults` calls.

## 2026-03-19 - Task: Fix Python Datasource Nested JsonData Deep Merge
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`
- Baseline: Python `datasource add` merged preset/default `jsonData` with user `--json-data` using a shallow top-level update, so nested scaffolds such as Tempo `tracesToLogsV2` lost sibling keys when one nested field was overridden.
- Current Update: Switched the add-path `jsonData` merge to a recursive object merge that preserves preset sibling keys while still keeping the derived top-level flag conflict checks intact, and added a Tempo regression test for a nested `tracesToLogsV2.datasourceUid` override.
- Result: Python add now matches the Rust nested merge behavior for preset/default `jsonData` scaffolds, including the Tempo full-profile case that previously flattened nested objects.

## 2026-03-19 - Task: Fix Python Datasource Modify Nested JsonData Deep Merge
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`
- Baseline: Python `datasource modify` still merged existing `jsonData` with explicit `--json-data` using a shallow top-level update, so nested objects such as Tempo `tracesToLogsV2` lost sibling keys when one nested field was overridden.
- Current Update: Switched the modify-path payload builder to reuse the same recursive object merge used by datasource add, and added a Tempo regression test that overrides only `tracesToLogsV2.datasourceUid`.
- Result: Python modify now preserves nested scaffold siblings during partial `jsonData` overrides, matching the Rust nested merge behavior for the same shape.

## 2026-03-19 - Task: Add Datasource Secure Json Merge Coverage
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/datasource_secure_json_merge_cases.json`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: `secureJsonData` add/modify behavior was covered by ad hoc tests, but there was no shared fixture that explicitly locked merge-versus-replace semantics for secrets.
- Current Update: Added a dedicated shared fixture with one add case that preserves explicit `secureJsonData` unchanged and one modify case that confirms the secure secret object is replaced wholesale rather than merged with existing keys.
- Result: Rust now has fixture-driven coverage for the current secure secret semantics, making the replace-on-modify behavior explicit and regression-tested.

## 2026-03-19 - Task: Preserve Rust Datasource Auth Metadata During Modify
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Rust `datasource modify` carried `jsonData` and `secureJsonData` forward, but it dropped existing top-level auth metadata such as `basicAuth`, `basicAuthUser`, `user`, and `withCredentials` unless the same flags were repeated on the edit command.
- Current Update: Taught the modify-path payload builder to preserve those auth fields from the existing datasource when no explicit replacement flag is present, and added regressions that keep the auth metadata intact during unrelated edits while rejecting password-only modify payloads that have no `basicAuthUser` to bind to.
- Result: Rust datasource modify now behaves like a partial update for auth metadata instead of silently clearing it during unrelated edits, and it still fails closed on password updates that cannot be associated with a user.

## 2026-03-18 - Task: Align Rust Dashboard Permission Export Docs And Tests
- State: Done
- Scope: `README.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/overview-rust.md`, `rust/src/dashboard/export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/files.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/live.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/models.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Operator docs already described `raw/permissions.json` backup behavior at a shared CLI level, but Rust architecture docs and Rust export tests still focused on `folders.json` and `datasources.json` only, so the Rust-side contract drifted from the intended permission-backup shape.
- Current Update: Wired Rust dashboard export to fetch dashboard/folder ACLs, write `raw/permissions.json`, record `permissionsFile` in raw export metadata, and keep import/discovery treating the permission bundle as metadata only. Added the extra permission API mocks needed by inspect-live tests and aligned operator/Rust-overview docs with the now-real Rust behavior.
- Result: Rust `dashboard export` now matches the documented backup contract by writing `raw/permissions.json` alongside `folders.json` and `datasources.json`, while Rust `dashboard import` still ignores the bundle and restores content only.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Avoid Hard Pillow Dependency During Python CLI Import
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/screenshot.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_screenshot_import.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python screenshot helper already had a lazy `_pil_modules()` loader for Pillow, but the module still imported `PIL` at file import time. CI `python-quality` installs only the base package, so importing `dashboard_cli` and any higher-level CLI modules failed early with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` even when screenshot functionality was not being used.
- Current Update: Removed the eager Pillow import and added a regression test that proves the screenshot helper can be imported while `PIL` is unavailable, preserving the existing runtime-only failure path for actual screenshot composition calls.
- Result: Full Python unittest discovery now passes again without requiring Pillow for generic CLI imports, which aligns local behavior with the intended lazy screenshot dependency contract.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Install Pillow For Python Quality Screenshot Tests
- State: Done
- Scope: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After removing the hard import from the screenshot helper, the broad CLI import failures were fixed, but the CI `python-quality` job still installed only the base package. The screenshot helper test suite imports `PIL` directly, so the GitHub Actions run still failed on `test_python_dashboard_screenshot_helper` before reaching the rest of the suite.
- Current Update: Updating the CI quality install step to include Pillow explicitly and extending the packaging test to lock that workflow dependency into the repo contract.
- Result: The CI quality workflow now provisions Pillow for screenshot-helper tests without changing the published base package dependency set, and the local full Python discovery suite still passes end to end.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Export Dashboard Permission Metadata By Default
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/grafana_utils/clients/dashboard_client.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/export_runtime.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/export_workflow.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python dashboard export already wrote raw dashboard JSON, prompt dashboard JSON, `folders.json`, `datasources.json`, and `export-metadata.json`, but it did not persist dashboard or folder ACL state anywhere. The repo had an unwired permission workbench, so operators could not capture dashboard/folder permission metadata as part of a normal backup/export run.
- Current Update: Wired the staged dashboard/folder permission bundle into the live Python dashboard export path so raw exports now write a default `permissions.json` bundle plus a `permissionsFile` pointer in raw export metadata. Updated raw-export discovery paths to ignore the extra metadata file during dashboard import and offline governance scans, and extended the dashboard Python tests to lock the new export contract in place.
- Result: Python `dashboard export` now backs up dashboard and folder ACL metadata by default without changing the current restore semantics. Operators get a reviewable `raw/permissions.json` artifact in the same export root, while `dashboard import` continues to restore content only and ignores the permission bundle for now.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Add Alert List Org Routing And Finish Inspect-Live Multi-Org Support
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_client.rs`, `rust/src/alert_list.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The guides already described cross-org alert inventory, but Python and Rust alert list commands still only supported current-org scope. Rust `dashboard inspect-live` also exposed `--all-orgs` in parser/help while the runtime still rejected it and told operators to export first.
- Current Update: Added `--org-id` and `--all-orgs` to Python and Rust alert list commands with Basic-auth-only org switching, per-org client rebuilding, and `org` / `orgId` output enrichment when rows carry explicit org scope. Reworked Rust `inspect-live --all-orgs` to reuse the existing live export flow, merge multi-org raw inventories into one temporary inspect root, and feed that combined root back through the existing inspect-export analysis path.
- Result: Cross-org alert inventory now works in both runtimes, and Rust `dashboard inspect-live --all-orgs` now behaves consistently with its documented CLI contract instead of failing at runtime.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Align Python Datasource List Org Routing With Advertised CLI
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/listing.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo help text and Rust implementation already advertised `grafana-util datasource list --org-id` and `--all-orgs`, but the Python datasource parser and workflow only supported current-org listing. That caused Python/unified CLI users to hit parser errors or lose org metadata even though the docs implied the flags were available.
- Current Update: Added Python datasource-list parsing and validation for `--org-id` and `--all-orgs`, enforced the same Basic-auth-only org-switching rule already used by other admin-style workflows, and extended datasource list rendering so table/CSV/JSON outputs automatically include `org` and `orgId` when rows carry explicit org scope.
- Result: Python datasource list now matches the advertised CLI contract and the Rust behavior for explicit-org and multi-org inventory runs, including enriched org-aware output for aggregated results. Focused validation passed with `python3 -m unittest -v tests.test_python_datasource_cli`.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Aggregate Rust Build Outputs Across Current Target Set
- State: Done
- Scope: `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `make build-rust` only ran the native-host `cargo build --release` path, while the Linux `amd64` cross-build lived behind a separate target. That made the default Rust build path easy to misread as “all released artifacts” even though it only produced the local platform binary.
- Current Update: Split the native-only path into `make build-rust-native`, changed `make build-rust` to aggregate the native build plus the Docker-based Linux `amd64` build, and had the Make targets print the produced artifact paths after success.
- Result: The default Rust build target now matches the expectation of “build the current shipped target set” more closely, while maintainers still have an explicit native-only target when they only need the local executable.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Retire Rust Access Shim Binary
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/bin/grafana-access-utils.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/overview-rust.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already centered current operator guidance on `grafana-util access ...`, but the Rust crate still emitted a separate `grafana-access-utils` binary, unified help still advertised that compatibility shim, and active docs/tests still implied the split executable was part of the supported output.
- Current Update: Removed the standalone Rust `grafana-access-utils` binary target, renamed the access-root help surface to `grafana-util access`, removed shim language from the unified help text, and updated active docs/tests to describe one Rust executable surface.
- Result: Rust release builds now produce only the unified `grafana-util` executable for current CLI usage, which keeps the shipped artifacts aligned with the merged access command model and removes an unnecessary source of operator confusion.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Formalize Version Sync Workflow
- State: Done
- Scope: `VERSION`, `scripts/set-version.sh`, `Makefile`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_version_script.py`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had a checked-in `VERSION` file and an unpublished `scripts/set-version.sh`, but the file was stale, the script only updated `pyproject.toml` and `rust/Cargo.toml`, `Makefile` exposed no version targets, and release merges still left maintainers hand-fixing `pyproject.toml`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.lock`.
- Current Update: Updated `VERSION` to the current release line, taught `scripts/set-version.sh` to sync `rust/Cargo.lock` and to accept test-time path overrides, exposed `print-version`, `sync-version`, `set-release-version`, and `set-dev-version` in `Makefile`, and added focused Python tests for the script plus packaging assertions for the new workflow files and targets.
- Result: The repo now has one documented version-sync path for preview and release bumps, and the lockfile package version no longer drifts from `pyproject.toml` / `rust/Cargo.toml` during scripted version changes.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Wire Live Sync Fetch And Apply Across Python And Rust
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/sync_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_sync_cli.py`, `rust/src/sync.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync_cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python `sync` can already fetch live dashboard/folder/datasource state and can execute live apply for those resource kinds, but it still rejects `alert` operations during live apply. Rust `sync` currently remains local/document-only: plan/preflight/bundle-preflight do not support `--fetch-live`, apply emits only a staged intent with no `--execute-live` path, and alert sync stays staged only in both runtimes.
- Current Update: Extended Python live planning to fetch alert rules and extended Python live apply to create, update, and delete alert rules through the provisioning API when the sync operation carries a complete rule payload. Extended Rust `sync` to accept `--fetch-live` on plan/preflight/bundle-preflight, added `--execute-live` plus `--allow-folder-delete` / `--org-id` on apply, implemented live fetch for folders/dashboards/datasources/alert rules plus live availability probing, and wired live apply for folders/dashboards/datasources/alert rules. Updated unified Rust help/tests to advertise and parse the live sync flags.
- Result: Python and Rust `sync` now both support live-backed planning plus live apply for the same core resource kinds, including alert rules. The alert path still fails closed when a sync alert spec is only a partial ownership document and cannot satisfy the full rule payload required by Grafana provisioning APIs.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Audit CLI Help Examples And Grouped Parameters
- State: In Progress
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/sync_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_sync_cli.py`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync.rs`, `rust/src/sync_cli_rust_tests.rs`
- Baseline: Several command surfaces still mixed rich help with bare parser output. Python `access` had almost no `Examples:` coverage at either the root or subcommand level, Python `alert` only documented examples on the root parser, Python `sync` had per-subcommand examples but no root examples or grouped option sections, and Rust `access` / `datasource` / `sync` roots still exposed no example usage.
- Current Update: Added root-level and per-subcommand example epilogs across Python `access`, Python `alert`, and Python `sync`, grouped Python auth/transport/input/output/apply options where the parser shape made that possible, and added focused help assertions for the newly documented flows. Added root example help text for Rust `access`, `datasource`, and `sync`, plus grouped help headings on Rust access auth/transport arguments and focused help tests that lock those new examples in place.
- Result: The main Python and Rust entrypoints now advertise real operator command lines instead of only bare usage syntax, and mutation-heavy paths such as access import/delete and sync apply now surface their acknowledgement flags together with example usage. A broader follow-up pass is still needed if we want every remaining Rust leaf subcommand to carry dedicated `after_help` examples instead of relying on root coverage.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Expose Dashboard Dependency Contracts As First-Class Inspect Output
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_dispatch.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_runtime.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Inspect summary, flat query reports, grouped tree reports, and governance outputs were already documented, but the newer dependency-contract path was only implicit in code and newer tests. User-facing docs still described `--output-format` too narrowly and did not spell out the current validation rules around report columns and datasource filters.
- Current Update: Added Python and Rust inspect support for `dependency` / `dependency-json` via `--report` and `report-dependency` / `report-dependency-json` via `--output-format`, wired offline dependency-contract rendering through the shared datasource inventory path, and documented the stricter report validation rules. The docs now describe dependency output as a maintained contract rather than an internal side path.
- Result: Operators can discover dependency-contract output directly from the docs, and maintainers have an explicit trace entry for the Python/Rust inspect surface expansion and shared dependency model split.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Shift Dashboard Governance Gate Toward Governance-Json-First Inputs
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_governance.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_governance_gate.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_governance_gate.py`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The initial governance gate still depended on raw export rescans for plugin and datasource-variable checks because Python governance JSON did not yet carry `dashboardDependencies`-style dependency facts.
- Current Update: Added Python governance JSON `dashboardDependencies` rows with plugin ids, datasource variables, datasource variable references, and file/folder dependency context. Updated the governance gate to prefer those facts directly from `governance.json`, leaving `--import-dir` only as a compatibility fallback, and extended the safe rule set with library panel allowlists plus explicit folder-prefix routing rules.
- Result: The preferred governance gate contract is now `policy + governance-json + report-json`, and the checker can enforce plugin, library-panel, datasource-variable, and folder-routing policies without rescanning raw dashboards in the common case.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Add External Dashboard Governance Gate For CI
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_governance_gate.py`, `scripts/check_dashboard_governance.py`, `examples/dashboard-governance-policy.json`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_governance_gate.py`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had mature `inspect-export` governance/query reports, but there was no checked-in policy gate that could consume those reports in CI and fail builds when dashboards violated datasource or query-governance rules.
- Current Update: Added a first-pass external governance checker module plus thin script wrapper that reads a policy JSON, one `governance-json` report, one flat query-report JSON, and optionally a raw dashboard export directory for plugin/templating checks, then emits text or JSON results with nonzero exit codes for blocking violations. The current rules cover datasource family/uid allowlists, unknown datasource identity, mixed-datasource dashboards, panel plugin allowlists, undefined datasource variables referenced from panel/query datasource fields, query-count thresholds, query/dashboard complexity scores, SQL `select *`, missing SQL time-filter macros, and broad Loki selectors.
- Result: The repo now has an operator-usable CI gate that can turn existing inspect artifacts plus raw export metadata into governance enforcement without locking the main dashboard CLI into one team's policy contract.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Align Python And Rust Dashboard Inspect Report Contracts
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_help.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust inspect report rendering already emitted `datasource_type`, `datasource_family`, and `file`, and Rust datasource filtering already matched datasource label, uid, type, or family. Python still documented datasource-label-only filtering, and the remaining inspect backlog item was tracking help/filter/schema drift between the two runtimes.
- Current Update: Aligned the shared inspect-export/live contract across Python and Rust by keeping datasource filter matching on label, uid, type, or family in both runtimes, updating normal/full help text to advertise the richer report-column set, and tightening focused tests around the shared filter/help behavior.
- Result: Python and Rust inspect-export/live now present the same operator-facing datasource filter semantics and the same report-column contract in help text and focused tests, so the active inspect parity backlog item is no longer current.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Let Rust Bundle Preflight Fall Back To Raw Alert Rule Documents
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync_bundle_preflight.rs`, `rust/src/sync_bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust bundle-preflight only consumed top-level `alerts` from a source bundle. When a bundle still carried alert exports only under `alerting.rules[*].document`, the staged sync-preflight path ignored those alert rules entirely and missed alert datasource and contact-point dependency checks.
- Current Update: Added a Rust bundle-preflight fallback that derives minimal staged alert sync specs from raw alert rule export documents under `alerting.rules`, while still preferring explicit top-level `alerts` when those are already present.
- Result: Rust bundle-preflight now surfaces alert dependency failures from bundled raw alert rule exports even before the source-bundle builder fully materializes top-level alert specs, which closes most of the remaining alert-dependency blind spot in the current bundle contract.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Normalize Rust Source Bundle Alert Specs
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync.rs`, `rust/src/sync_workbench.rs`, `rust/src/sync_cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync_bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust `sync bundle` already carried raw `alerting.rules[*].document` exports, but the emitted source bundle still left top-level `alerts` empty. That meant downstream staged sync flows had to rely on bundle-preflight fallbacks instead of receiving normalized alert sync specs directly from the source-bundle artifact.
- Current Update: Added Rust alert normalization that derives top-level alert sync specs from bundled alert rule exports, supports both `grafana-alert-rule` tool documents and raw `groups[].rules[]` documents, carries safe dependency-oriented fields such as `condition`, `annotations`, `contactPoints`, `datasourceUids`, `datasourceNames`, `pluginIds`, and `data`, and passes those normalized alerts into `build_sync_source_bundle_document(...)`.
- Result: Rust source bundles now emit non-empty top-level `alerts` when the alert export contains enough rule detail, which lets downstream bundle review and staged sync paths consume normalized alert specs directly instead of depending solely on raw `alerting` documents.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Clarify Remaining Rust Sync Bundle Alert Gap
- State: Done
- Scope: `TODO.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The active backlog still described the Rust export package/bundle work as if the whole workflow were missing, even though the current tree already packages dashboards, folders, datasource inventory, bundle metadata, and raw `alerting` sections. That wording no longer pointed maintainers at the actual remaining alert-side gap.
- Current Update: Narrowed the backlog and maintainer notes to the real remaining Rust sync bundle problem: deriving safe normalized top-level alert sync specs from raw alert exports so bundle-preflight and downstream sync stages can consume `alerts` directly instead of relying only on raw `alerting` documents.
- Result: The maintainer docs and active backlog now describe the bundle workflow as partially complete and identify the remaining alert normalization step as the next focused Rust gap.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Tighten Rust Sync Bundle And Preflight Dependency Coverage
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync.rs`, `rust/src/sync_preflight.rs`, `rust/src/sync_workbench.rs`, `rust/src/sync_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync_cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync_bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust sync preflight already checked datasource uid/name availability plus datasource plugin types for datasource resources, and the first-pass Rust `sync bundle` workflow could package dashboards, datasource inventory, and raw alerting sections. But dashboard/alert specs could not declare their own plugin dependencies in preflight, bundled datasource inventory dropped secret-provider metadata needed by provider assessment, and the bundle CLI tests did not prove that provider metadata survived into downstream bundle-preflight evaluation.
- Current Update: Added optional dashboard and alert `pluginIds` checks to Rust sync preflight so staged specs can block on missing plugin availability before mutation. Preserved `secureJsonDataProviders` and `secureJsonDataPlaceholders` when normalizing datasource inventory into the Rust source bundle, recorded `alertExportDir` in bundle metadata, and added focused Rust tests that verify bundle output preserves provider metadata and that bundle-preflight can read provider references back out of a source-bundle document.
- Result: Rust sync preflight now covers one broader class of non-datasource plugin dependencies, and the Rust source-bundle workflow now carries enough datasource provider metadata for bundle-preflight/provider assessment to work against bundle artifacts instead of only hand-built fixture documents.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Exercise Rust Sync Bundle Alert Normalization Paths
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync_cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/sync_bundle_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust sync bundle and bundle-preflight coverage already proved datasource provider metadata and alert export directory provenance, but they still did not exercise the expected top-level `alerts` normalization path end to end. The live smoke harness also had no `grafana-util sync ...` path at all.
- Current Update: Added bundle CLI test coverage with a realistic raw alert-rule export fixture that asserts the source bundle carries a normalized top-level alert spec, added bundle-preflight coverage that counts a source bundle containing alert specs alongside dashboard and datasource records, and extended the Rust live smoke script to package the seeded dashboard/alert exports through `grafana-util sync bundle` plus `sync bundle-preflight`.
- Result: Once the source-bundle normalization path is present, the checked-in Rust tests and live smoke harness now exercise it directly instead of only validating adjacent alerting summary/provider metadata behavior.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Split Rust Full-Page Screenshot Output
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust `dashboard screenshot --full-page` always stitched the entire page into one raster file. That worked, but very tall dashboards produced oversized PNG/JPEG artifacts and there was no supported way to emit smaller segmented files.
- Current Update: Added `--full-page-output single|tiles|manifest` to the Rust screenshot CLI. The runtime now captures full-page segments once, then either stitches them into the existing single-file output, writes numbered `part-0001.*` tiles into a derived output directory, or writes the same tile set plus `manifest.json` metadata with viewport/crop/scroll details. Validation now rejects `tiles` or `manifest` without `--full-page`, and rejects PDF split output because PDF remains single-file only.
- Result: Operators can keep the old one-file behavior by default or switch long dashboard captures to multi-file output that is easier to store, review, and post-process without changing the existing screenshot route for normal captures.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Add Rust Screenshot Device Scale Factor
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust screenshot capture exposed viewport `--width` and `--height`, but it had no Python-style `--device-scale-factor`. Operators could make the CSS viewport bigger, but they could not request denser PNG/JPEG output without also changing layout width and height.
- Current Update: Added `--device-scale-factor` with default `1.0`, validated it as greater than zero, and wired Chromium `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` into the Rust screenshot runtime. Updated full-page clip/stitch math to convert crop and scroll offsets from CSS pixels into output pixels so high-density full-page captures stay aligned.
- Result: Rust screenshot capture now accepts commands such as `--device-scale-factor 2 --width 2200 --height 1600`, including full-page PNG/JPEG output at higher raster density without changing the dashboard's CSS viewport geometry.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Add Rust Dashboard Screenshot Command
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust dashboard CLI currently supports list/export/import/diff/inspect workflows only. There is no screenshot or PDF capture subcommand, no browser automation runtime, and no code path that can capture the rendered Grafana dashboard UI as an image or PDF.
- Current Update: Added a Rust-only `dashboard screenshot` workflow with clap args for dashboard UID, slug, panel id, time range, repeatable `--var`, theme, viewport, wait time, browser path, org header, and output format selection. Added a new browser-capture module that launches Chromium through `headless_chrome`, reuses the existing auth header builder, constructs dashboard or solo-panel URLs, reserves a local debug port explicitly, hides Grafana chrome before capture, derives a clip from live page dimensions for `--full-page`, and writes PNG, JPEG, or PDF output after a render wait. Fixed the initial screenshot bugs where the capture path passed the wrong `headless_chrome` flag and where full-page dimension reads expected a JSON object instead of primitive values, then tightened the DOM cleanup to collapse the left menu first, hide sticky/fixed top bars more aggressively, and preserve datasource-style template variable routing through repeatable `--var NAME=VALUE` query pairs.
- Result: The Rust dashboard CLI now supports `grafana-util dashboard screenshot ...` through unified dispatch, the new screenshot helper behavior is covered by focused parser/help/URL/validation tests, the Rust `dashboard` plus `cli` test targets pass, and live checks against both local Docker Grafana and the user-provided remote dashboard produced browser-rendered full-page PNG output with the sidebar removed while keeping dark-mode and template-variable-driven dashboard selection intact.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Add Python Dashboard Inspect Vars And Screenshot Commands
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/variable_inspection.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/screenshot.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_variable_inspection.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_screenshot_helper.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_capture_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli_dashboard_capture.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python dashboard support already covered export/list/import/diff/inspect-export/inspect-live, but it still lacked Rust's `dashboard inspect-vars` and `dashboard screenshot` commands. Python unified CLI also did not expose those dashboard subcommands or the short `db` / `sy` aliases that Rust already supported.
- Current Update: Added a Python live variable-inspection helper that resolves dashboard UID from `--dashboard-uid` or Grafana URLs, extracts `templating.list`, applies `vars-query` overlays, and renders table/CSV/JSON output. Added a Python screenshot helper that validates capture args, parses `--var` and `vars-query` state, builds `/d/...` and `/d-solo/...` capture URLs, preserves a `/render/...` builder for future/fallback use, and now defaults to a browser-driven Chromium DevTools flow that injects Grafana auth headers directly into the page session instead of routing through `/render`. Follow-up work on the same path added live slug fail-open for direct `--dashboard-url` capture, Rust-style DOM readiness checks, sidebar/topbar cleanup, a Rust-style full-page scroll-and-stitch PNG/JPEG path so long dashboards no longer rely on one giant browser clip, and Python runtime support for Rust-like screenshot metadata/header fields (`print-capture-url`, header title/url/captured-at/text) on raster outputs.
- Result: The Python CLI now accepts `grafana-util dashboard inspect-vars ...` and `grafana-util dashboard screenshot ...`, the unified Python entrypoint routes both commands through the dashboard namespace, focused Python screenshot/CLI tests pass, and live checks against `https://192.168.1.112:3000` succeeded for both variable inspection and browser-driven PNG capture without using Grafana `/render`, including stitched full-page PNG output for the long `node-exporter-full` dashboard URL. The screenshot runtime now also has the image-header composition path needed for Rust-style title/url/captured-at annotations on PNG/JPEG outputs.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Recover Sync And Workbench Modules After Reverse
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/sync_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/gitops_sync.py`, `grafana_utils/*workbench.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_sync_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_*workbench.py`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/sync.rs`, `rust/src/sync_*.rs`, `rust/src/alert_sync.rs`, `rust/src/bundle_preflight.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_provider.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/*.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/set-version.sh`
- Baseline: The current tree had lost the Rust sync command surface plus its supporting sync/preflight/provider modules, and the same reverse also removed the Python sync/workbench modules, their tests, and several internal design notes. Rust unified CLI help and dispatch no longer exposed `sync`, while Python unified CLI also no longer routed `grafana-util sync ...`.
- Current Update: Restored the deleted Python and Rust sync/workbench module files from the earlier dev commit, reconnected Python unified CLI routing for `grafana-util sync ...`, and reconnected Rust unified CLI routing for `grafana-util sync ...` while keeping the requested canonical-only Rust rule that rejects legacy direct forms. Preserved the short Rust namespace aliases `db` and `sy`.
- Result: The repo again contains the staged sync/preflight/workbench implementation set in both runtimes, Python and Rust unified CLIs both route `sync`, and the focused recovered test suites pass.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Remove Rust Unified CLI Legacy Direct Commands
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust unified CLI still accepted top-level legacy direct commands such as `list-dashboard` and `export-alert`, and `--help` still advertised compatibility direct forms. That regressed the intended canonical command shape where operators should use `grafana-util <module> <command>`.
- Current Update: Removed Rust top-level legacy direct routing and dashboard command aliases for `list-dashboard`, `export-dashboard`, and `import-dashboard`. Kept a short namespace alias so `grafana-util db ...` still routes to `dashboard ...`, and updated focused Rust parser/help tests to reject the removed direct forms while accepting `db`.
- Result: The Rust unified CLI now enforces namespaced commands such as `grafana-util dashboard list` or `grafana-util db list`, and its help output no longer reintroduces removed compatibility direct forms.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Align Shared CLI Help And User Guides
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The shared user guides still framed examples around Rust source-tree commands, datasource help examples were inconsistent between root and subcommand help, and the Traditional Chinese user guide contained malformed Markdown tables plus mixed terminology around legacy compatibility paths.
- Current Update: Switched shared user-guide examples to the neutral `grafana-util ...` / `grafana-access-utils ...` command shape, refreshed unified CLI help text to describe legacy entrypoints as compatibility forms without runtime warnings, expanded datasource root/subcommand help examples, and repaired the malformed Markdown tables plus terminology in the Traditional Chinese guide.
- Result: Operators now see one shared CLI shape in the public guides, datasource help output includes actionable examples at both the group and subcommand level, and the compatibility-path wording stays visible in help/docs without changing legacy command behavior.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Python Datasource Org-Scoped Export And Routed Import
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python datasource export stayed current-org-only, and datasource import only supported the current org or one explicit `--org-id`. There was no Python support for `datasource export --org-id`, `datasource export --all-orgs`, `datasource import --use-export-org`, repeatable `--only-org-id`, or `--create-missing-orgs`.
- Current Update: Added Python datasource export org scoping with Basic-auth-only `--org-id` and `--all-orgs`, writing `org_<id>_<name>/` subdirectories plus one aggregate root manifest for multi-org exports. Added Python datasource routed import with `--use-export-org`, repeatable `--only-org-id`, and `--create-missing-orgs`, including org-level dry-run preview for `missing-org` and `would-create-org`.
- Result: The Python datasource CLI now supports the same explicit-org and routed-org operator model already used by dashboard import/export, while preserving the existing single-org datasource export/import behavior when the new flags are not used.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Routed Dashboard Import Live Smoke Coverage
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The existing Rust live Grafana smoke script covered single-org dashboard export/import/diff/dry-run and alerting flows, but it did not exercise routed dashboard import from a combined multi-org export root. There was no live smoke path for `--use-export-org`, `--only-org-id`, `--create-missing-orgs`, or the new routed dry-run org preview semantics.
- Current Update: Extended the Rust live smoke script to create a second org and dashboard, export dashboards with `--all-orgs`, verify routed dry-run preview for one selected org, verify routed `--create-missing-orgs --dry-run` reports a would-create state after deleting that org, and verify live `--use-export-org --create-missing-orgs` recreates the org and restores its dashboard.
- Result: The checked-in Rust live smoke harness now covers routed multi-org dashboard import preview and recreate behavior in addition to the existing single-org dashboard and alerting checks.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Org-Aware Dry-Run Preview
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Routed dashboard import already supported `--use-export-org`, `--only-org-id`, and live `--create-missing-orgs`, but dry-run still failed closed for missing destination orgs and refused `--create-missing-orgs --dry-run`. Operators could not preview whether each exported org already existed or would need creation before import.
- Current Update: Changed routed dry-run so it now emits one org-level preview line per selected exported org, reporting `orgAction=exists`, `orgAction=missing-org`, or `orgAction=would-create-org` plus the source/target org ids and dashboard count. Existing target orgs still run through the current per-dashboard dry-run path, while missing-org cases stay non-mutating and skip live org creation.
- Result: `dashboard import --use-export-org --dry-run` now previews destination-org existence and would-create behavior without mutating Grafana, both with and without `--create-missing-orgs`.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Routing By Exported Org
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/clients/dashboard_client.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_runtime.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import only supported one destination org per run. Operators could target the current org or one explicit `--org-id`, and `--require-matching-export-org` only acted as a safety guard. There was no way to point import at a combined `--all-orgs` export root, filter selected exported orgs, or create missing destination orgs before routed import.
- Current Update: Added `--use-export-org` to route one combined multi-org export root back into Grafana by each exported orgId, added repeatable `--only-org-id` filtering, and added `--create-missing-orgs` so missing destination orgs can be created from the exported org name before import continues. Kept `--use-export-org` Basic-auth-only, blocked incompatible flag combinations, and later extended routed dry-run so `--create-missing-orgs --dry-run` now previews `would-create` org state instead of failing closed.
- Result: Dashboard import can now replay multi-org exports back into matching org contexts with explicit filtering and optional destination-org creation, while the existing single-org import workflow remains unchanged.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Safer Access User Password Input
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_user.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `access user add --password` and `access user modify --set-password` currently take cleartext passwords directly from CLI flags, and user import only accepts inline `password` fields when creating missing global users. There is no prompt-based or file-based password input path for access user lifecycle commands.
- Current Update: Added prompt/file-based password input for Python and Rust `access user add` and `access user modify`, kept existing explicit `--password` and `--set-password` behavior, and resolved password values before user lifecycle requests are sent.
- Result: Operators can now use `--password-file` or `--prompt-user-password` on create and `--set-password-file` or `--prompt-set-password` on modify, reducing the need to pass cleartext passwords directly on the command line.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Access Org Management
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_org.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The access CLIs supported users, teams, and service accounts, but there was no first-class org surface for list/add/modify/delete or snapshot export/import. Existing `access user` flows could only target org-local behavior indirectly through `--org-id`, `--set-org-role`, or `--scope org`, and there was no explicit org membership replay path.
- Current Update: Added `access org` to the Python and Rust CLIs with Basic-auth-only list/add/modify/delete/export/import workflows, org export bundles (`orgs.json` plus `export-metadata.json`), and import replay that can create missing orgs plus add or role-update org users from snapshot records.
- Result: Python and Rust now both expose explicit organization management in the access domain, and the current user-management semantics remain available for direct global user creation plus org-scoped role/removal targeting.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Service-Account Snapshot Export Import Diff
- State: In Progress
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_service_account.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `access service-account` only supported list/add/delete and token lifecycle operations. There was no snapshot bundle for service accounts, no import replay path, and no live-vs-file drift command in either implementation.
- Current Update: Added CLI surface and request/client plumbing for `access service-account export`, `import`, and `diff`. The new snapshot contract uses `service-accounts.json` plus `export-metadata.json`, keys records by service-account name, and treats `role` plus `disabled` as the mutable reconciliation fields for import and diff.
- Result: Python and Rust now expose matching service-account snapshot workflows in the access domain, with create/update replay, dry-run import reporting, and drift summary output designed to mirror the existing access snapshot model.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Service-Account Snapshot Export Import And Diff
- State: Planned
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_service_account.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `access service-account` currently supports list/add/delete and token add/delete, but does not provide snapshot-style export/import/diff workflows like `access user` and `access team`. The public docs and support tables still describe service accounts as lifecycle-only resources.
- Current Update: Scoping Python and Rust changes so service-account snapshots follow the same bundle metadata, dry-run import, and drift diff model already used by user/team workflows.
- Result: Pending implementation.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Align Rust Inspect JSON Contract With Python
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_summary.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_report.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust `inspect-export --json` still serialized the internal `ExportInspectionSummary` struct directly, which kept snake_case count fields, exposed Rust-only field names such as `datasource_usage` and `mixed_dashboards`, and diverged from the Python summary/report JSON contract that already uses a wrapper document with camelCase keys.
- Current Update: Added dedicated Rust JSON document builders for summary and report inspection output, kept the internal runtime structs unchanged for text/table rendering, and switched the Rust inspect JSON paths to emit the Python-shaped document keys such as `summary.dashboardCount`, `datasourceInventory`, `orphanedDatasources`, `mixedDatasourceDashboards`, and `queries[*].query`.
- Result: Rust `inspect-export --json` and `inspect-live --output-format report-json` now emit a much closer machine-readable contract to the Python inspection output without changing the existing text, table, or governance renderers.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Standardize Python Development On Poetry
- State: Done
- Scope: `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python development instructions were split between direct `python3 -m unittest`, source-tree module execution, and packaged `pip install` examples without one declared standard environment manager for maintainers. The Python build shortcut also only emitted a wheel, leaving no committed Poetry lockfile or standard sdist path for downstream package-install workflows.
- Current Update: Declared Poetry as the standard Python development environment workflow, added a Poetry dev dependency group plus committed `poetry.lock`, introduced Poetry-oriented `make` targets, and switched `make build-python` to build both `sdist` and `wheel` through the Poetry-managed environment while keeping the existing setuptools packaging backend and `pip install` validation paths.
- Result: The repo now has one documented Python development workflow for maintainers, one committed Poetry lockfile for reproducible dev environments, and a standard Python build path that emits both `sdist` and `wheel` for downstream installation and release checks.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Maintainer Architecture Comments for Python CLI Facades
- State: Done
- Scope: `DEVELOPER.md`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_contract.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python CLI entrypoint and facade files were functionally stable but carried fewer maintainer-facing boundary notes than their module layout, making future refactors slower to reason about at a glance.
- Current Update: Added explicit module and function docstrings for unified routing, parser normalization, dispatch boundaries, and datasource contract semantics; added a DEVELOPER section for Python CLI boundary responsibilities.
- Result: No behavior changes. Future maintainers can now infer the intended separation between entrypoint routing and domain workflow ownership directly from source and maintainer documentation.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Cache Rust Dashboard Import Org Lookups
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard import already cached per-dashboard UID and folder lookups inside one import run, but routed import preview and `--use-export-org` planning still re-fetched `/api/orgs` for each exported org scope, and matching-export-org validation kept current-org lookup outside the same reusable import cache.
- Current Update: Extended the Rust import lookup cache to retain current-org ID and the admin org inventory, rewired matching-export-org validation to reuse the same cache, and rewired routed import planning/preview to reuse one `/api/orgs` fetch across all export scopes in the same run.
- Result: Large routed Rust imports now avoid repeated admin org inventory lookups during planning and dry-run preview while preserving existing import behavior and output contracts.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Tighten Rust Prompt Export Naming And Typed Alert Linkage
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_prompt.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust prompt export already rewrote datasource inputs and `__requires`, but plugin display names still fell back to generic title-casing for datasource types such as OpenSearch and PostgreSQL, and the prompt tests only covered a narrow Prometheus/Loki subset. The alert import path also still passed raw dashboard/panel linkage maps down through rewrite helpers instead of one typed linkage context.
- Current Update: Added Grafana-style datasource plugin display names for common datasource families, carried those names through prompt input and `__requires` rendering, and extended Rust dashboard tests with broader same-type object-reference coverage plus OpenSearch/PostgreSQL naming/version assertions. Replaced the alert import path's raw dashboard/panel linkage map pair with a typed `AlertLinkageMappings` helper that loads and resolves dashboard and panel remaps through explicit methods.
- Result: Rust prompt export is closer to Grafana external export naming for common datasource plugins, the prompt test surface now covers broader same-type and non-Prometheus/Loki cases, and alert linkage rewriting no longer threads ad hoc nested maps through the import/diff path.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Deepen Rust Inspection Dependency Summaries
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_report.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_render.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust inspect report output already exposed flat per-query rows plus governance family coverage, but the grouped tree output still summarized dashboards and panels only by counts, governance JSON did not include explicit dashboard dependency rows, and `--report-filter-datasource` only matched the rendered datasource label rather than the uid/type/family fields already present in the report rows.
- Current Update: Extended normalized grouped query models with dashboard/panel datasource families, datasource labels, query-field lists, and dashboard file paths so tree and tree-table output can surface dependency shape directly in section headers. Added governance `dashboardDependencies` rows with dashboard file, datasource, family, panel-count, and query-count coverage, and widened Rust datasource report filtering to match exact datasource label, uid, type, or family values.
- Result: Rust inspect-export / inspect-live output now carries richer dependency summaries inside the existing tree/governance surfaces, and operators can narrow report output by datasource uid/type/family without adding new CLI flags.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Drop Python 3.6 Compatibility As A Contributor Constraint
- State: Done
- Scope: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The published package metadata already required Python 3.9+, and the active syntax-floor tests already validated Python 3.9 parseability, but the repo instructions still told contributors to keep new code parseable under Python 3.6 and framed RHEL 8-era compatibility as an active coding constraint.
- Current Update: Updated the repo contributor instructions and maintainer notes to make Python 3.9+ the explicit development baseline, removed the remaining guidance that told contributors to preserve Python 3.6 parser compatibility, and clarified that new work can use Python 3.9-era language features where appropriate.
- Result: Repo policy now matches packaging metadata, current tests, and current maintainer intent: Python 3.9+ is the supported baseline, and Python 3.6 compatibility is no longer a requirement for new code.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Expand Rust Access Live Smoke And Clear Stale TLS TODOs
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The checked-in Rust live smoke covered dashboard, alerting, and datasource workflows, but it did not enter the `access` namespace at all. At the same time, `TODO.md` still claimed shared access TLS flags such as `--insecure` and `--ca-cert` were unimplemented even though parser/runtime support had already landed in both runtimes.
- Current Update: Extended the Rust Docker smoke script to exercise representative destructive access paths with `--insecure`, including user org/global delete, team delete, org delete, and service-account token/service-account delete after creating the corresponding live objects. Added focused Rust parser coverage that asserts those destructive commands accept `--insecure`, refreshed maintainer notes for the expanded Rust smoke surface, and cleaned the stale TODO entries that still listed `--insecure` / `--ca-cert` as missing.
- Result: Rust now has a checked-in live validation path for the newer access delete surface instead of relying on Python-only smoke coverage, and the active backlog no longer misreports already-implemented access TLS flags as unfinished work.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Align Rust Inspection Orphaned Datasource Summary
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_summary.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` summary output already exposed `orphanedDatasourceCount` and `orphanedDatasources`, but the Rust inspection summary only carried datasource inventory and mixed-dashboard aggregates. That left the two runtimes with a visible summary capability gap even though the Rust governance path already knew how to derive orphaned datasource risk from the same inventory.
- Current Update: Added orphaned datasource count and orphaned datasource inventory rows to the Rust inspection summary model, wired the summary builder to materialize those rows directly from the datasource inventory usage counts, and extended the Rust dashboard tests to lock in the new summary fields.
- Result: Rust inspection summary output now exposes the same orphaned-datasource concept that Python summary output already had, reducing one concrete inspect-export/inspect-live drift point without changing the existing governance risk behavior.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Raise Python Baseline To 3.9
- State: Done
- Scope: `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/http_transport.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_contract.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_auth_staging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_governance.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_pending_cli_staging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python packaging metadata and current docs still declared `>=3.6`, the maintainer notes still told contributors to avoid Python 3.9 built-in generics, and the syntax-floor tests still locked covered Python modules to Python 3.6 parseability. That left the repo policy, contributor guidance, and static validation tied to an older compatibility floor than the current code needs.
- Current Update: Raised the published Python floor to 3.9 in `pyproject.toml`, updated current operator and maintainer docs to describe Python 3.9+ as the supported syntax/runtime baseline, switched representative shared Python modules to built-in generic annotations, and updated the syntax-floor tests to assert Python 3.9 parseability instead of Python 3.6.
- Result: The repo now consistently advertises and validates Python 3.9+ as the supported Python baseline, and touched shared modules can use Python 3.9 typing syntax without conflicting with packaging metadata or static syntax-floor tests.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Dashboard Inspection Models And Dispatch
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_models.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_summary.rs`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_dispatch.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` still owns the remaining export/index/inventory and inspection summary structs even after the earlier module split, while Python inspection still keeps the output-mode validation and report/summary dispatch logic inline in one workflow module. That leaves the Rust root module carrying typed payload details that belong with helper ownership and leaves the Python inspection path with more duplicated branch logic than needed to stay aligned with Rust.
- Current Update: Moved the remaining Rust dashboard export/index/inventory structs into `rust/src/dashboard_models.rs`, moved the inspection summary payload structs into `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_summary.rs`, and kept the existing `crate::dashboard` imports stable through re-exports. On the Python side, extracted inspect output-mode validation plus report/summary rendering dispatch into `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_dispatch.py` so `inspection_workflow.py` now focuses on temporary live-export materialization plus high-level workflow entrypoints.
- Result: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` now drops to a much smaller orchestration/root module instead of owning typed export and report payload shapes, while Python inspection output routing now has one shared dispatch path that stays easier to keep aligned with the Rust inspect behavior.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Rename Unified CLI To grafana-util
- State: Done
- Scope: `pyproject.toml`, `grafana_utils/__main__.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-util.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_help.rs`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-python-access-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64-zig.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The unified Python and Rust CLIs, repo-local wrapper path, packaging metadata, tests, and current docs all still present the primary tool name as `grafana-utils`, while Python packaging also still only includes the top-level `grafana_utils` package and would omit newly added subpackages on install.
- Current Update: Renamed the unified installed command and repo-local wrapper usage to `grafana-util`, renamed the Rust unified binary source entrypoint to `rust/src/bin/grafana-util.rs`, updated help text, tests, scripts, and current docs to the singular command name, and widened the Python setuptools package discovery to include `grafana_utils.*` so the split access and datasource subpackages remain installable.
- Result: The repo now presents one singular unified command name, `grafana-util`, across Python packaging, source-tree wrapper usage, Rust unified binary/help, tests, and current operator docs, while keeping existing export/import metadata kinds unchanged for compatibility and keeping Python subpackages included in packaged installs.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Python Access CLI Facade
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py` is still the largest Python CLI facade in the repo and currently mixes argparse wiring, auth validation, identity lookup helpers, user/team/service-account workflows, and top-level dispatch in one file even after earlier support-module extractions.
- Current Update: Split the argparse and CLI-shape wiring into `grafana_utils/access/parser.py`, moved access validation/lookup/workflow logic into `grafana_utils/access/workflows.py`, and reduced `grafana_utils/access_cli.py` to a stable facade that re-exports the tested helper surface while keeping auth prompting and top-level client dispatch local. Extended focused access tests with Python 3.6 syntax coverage for the new modules and updated maintainer notes to document the new boundaries.
- Result: Python access code now has a real `grafana_utils/access/` submodule layout instead of one oversized facade, while `grafana_utils.access_cli` and the unified CLI still expose the same external command and helper API expected by the existing tests.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Python Datasource CLI Facade
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/__init__.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py` still mixes argparse wiring, export/import/diff workflow logic, JSON/file bundle helpers, and top-level dispatch in one module even though the repo already uses subpackage boundaries for dashboard and access code.
- Current Update: Split datasource argparse wiring and dry-run column metadata into `grafana_utils/datasource/parser.py`, moved export/import/diff execution plus datasource bundle helpers into `grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, and reduced `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py` to a stable facade that re-exports the existing helper surface while forwarding execution through the submodules. Extended focused datasource tests with Python 3.6 syntax coverage for the new modules and updated maintainer notes to describe the datasource package layout.
- Result: Python datasource code now has a real `grafana_utils/datasource/` submodule boundary, while `grafana_utils.datasource_cli` and unified CLI dispatch still preserve the existing parser/help and helper behavior expected by the focused tests.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Import Dry-Run Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the shared live-helper extraction, `rust/src/dashboard.rs` was smaller but still carried the folder inventory dry-run record builder and table renderer used only by dashboard import. That left the root module holding import-only presentation logic that did not belong with the top-level dashboard facade.
- Current Update: Moved the folder inventory dry-run record builder and folder dry-run table renderer into `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, then kept the existing dashboard test import path stable through a test-only re-export from `dashboard.rs`.
- Result: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` dropped again from 568 lines to 478 lines, and the folder dry-run rendering logic now sits with the import workflow that actually owns it.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Help Surface
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_help.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Even after the live-helper and import dry-run cleanup, `rust/src/dashboard.rs` still owned the `--help-full` rendering helpers and long inspect example strings for `inspect-export` and `inspect-live`. Those helpers were stable, but they were unrelated to runtime orchestration and kept extra presentation-only detail in the root module.
- Current Update: Moved the dashboard `--help-full` rendering helpers and extended example text into `rust/src/dashboard_help.rs`, then kept the public `crate::dashboard` API stable by re-exporting the moved functions from `dashboard.rs`.
- Result: The Rust dashboard root module is smaller again, and the full-help rendering surface now lives in a dedicated module instead of in the orchestration root.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Live Orchestration Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_live.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_list.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust dashboard behavior was already split across CLI definitions, export, import, list, prompt, and inspect modules, but `rust/src/dashboard.rs` still held a large shared block of live Grafana request helpers plus folder inventory orchestration that export, import, and list all depended on through the root module. That made the root dashboard module keep growing even after earlier feature splits.
- Current Update: Extracted the shared live request and folder inventory helpers into `rust/src/dashboard_live.rs`, rewired `rust/src/dashboard.rs` to re-export the moved helpers, and left the existing export/import/list modules and dashboard tests on the same crate-level names.
- Result: The Rust dashboard root module dropped from 1017 lines to 568 lines without changing operator-facing behavior, and the shared Grafana fetch/folder reconciliation logic now lives in one dedicated helper module instead of continuing to accrete in `dashboard.rs`.
## 2026-03-14 - Task: Block Datasource Name-Match UID Drift Updates
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource import already blocked plugin-type changes and ambiguous matches, but `--replace-existing` still allowed updates that matched a live datasource only by exact `name` even when the exported `uid` and live `uid` disagreed. That left room for one datasource identity to overwrite another same-name datasource by mistake.
- Current Update: Added a shared update-safety rule in Python and Rust that turns same-name matches with differing non-empty UIDs into an explicit blocked action instead of a normal update, and added focused tests that lock in the new `would-fail-uid-mismatch` behavior.
- Result: Datasource import still allows normal UID matches and missing-datasource creates, but it no longer silently updates a same-name datasource when the underlying datasource identity has drifted.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Prompt Token Auth Flags
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_auth_staging.py`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/common_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/access_pending_delete.rs`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The CLI families already supported `--token` and `--prompt-password`, but operators still had to paste API tokens directly onto the command line or rely on env vars. That left token auth less safe for manual use than Basic auth, even though both secrets can leak through shell history or process args.
- Current Update: Added `--prompt-token` across the shared Python and Rust auth paths, wired the common parsers to accept it, prompted for the token without echo, and tightened validation so prompted token auth stays mutually exclusive with explicit token and Basic auth flags.
- Result: Operators can now use token auth interactively without exposing the token in shell history or process arguments, using a flag pattern that matches the existing `--prompt-password` behavior.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Python Prompt Token Support
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_auth_staging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python CLIs already supported explicit token auth and prompted Basic-auth passwords, but there was no secure interactive equivalent for token auth. Operators who wanted to avoid putting a Grafana API token in shell history still had to pass `--token` directly or rely on environment variables.
- Current Update: Added `--prompt-token` to the shared Python auth path and the dashboard, alert, and access parsers, wired it through the shared auth resolver, and added focused success/conflict coverage for prompted token input.
- Result: Python operators can now enter a Grafana API token through a non-echoed prompt with `--prompt-token`, while the CLIs still reject mixing token and Basic-auth inputs or combining `--prompt-token` with an explicit `--token`.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Reject Extra Datasource Contract Fields
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_contract.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_diff.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_diff.py`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_diff_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource export/import had a narrow normalized contract in practice, but the import and diff loaders still accepted `datasources.json` entries with extra fields and silently normalized them away. That meant server-managed fields, secret-bearing settings, and datasource-type-specific config blobs could still appear in import/diff inputs without an explicit failure.
- Current Update: Added shared datasource contract validation in Python, mirrored the same fail-closed validation in Rust datasource import/diff loaders, and added focused tests that reject extra fields such as `id`, `jsonData`, `secureJsonData`, and `password` instead of silently dropping them.
- Result: Datasource import and diff now enforce the documented normalized contract directly in both runtimes, so secret-bearing or server-managed datasource fields cause an explicit error instead of being ignored.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Align Datasource Contract Fixtures Across Python and Rust
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_contract.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_diff.py`, `fixtures/datasource_contract_cases.json`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_diff.py`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_diff_rust_tests.rs`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource export/import already used a deliberately small normalized contract, but Python still normalized some values more loosely than Rust, especially for `isDefault` and `orgId` when fixture inputs used booleans or numbers. The repo also did not yet have one shared cross-language datasource fixture set covering secret-bearing Prometheus, Loki, and InfluxDB cases.
- Current Update: Added a shared Python datasource contract helper for canonical string/bool normalization, rewired the Python datasource CLI and datasource diff helpers to use it, introduced one cross-language fixture file for Prometheus, Loki, and InfluxDB datasource cases with mixed auth/secret fields, and updated both Python and Rust datasource tests to validate normalized export records and import payloads against that same fixture set.
- Result: Python and Rust datasource tests now enforce the same normalized export/import contract from one fixture source, and Python no longer drifts on bool/int normalization for datasource inventory records.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Remove Rust Auth Legacy Aliases
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/common_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust dashboard, alert, and access CLIs still advertised the legacy Basic-auth aliases `--username` and `--password` alongside `--basic-user` and `--basic-password`. That kept help output noisy, left the shared Rust auth errors pointing at both old and new spellings, and directly conflicted with business flags like `access user add --password`.
- Current Update: Removed the Rust CLI auth aliases from the shared/common Clap definitions, updated the shared Rust auth validation messages to mention only `--basic-user`, `--basic-password`, and `--prompt-password`, and refreshed help/auth tests so the removed aliases stay gone.
- Result: Rust CLI Basic auth now uses one consistent flag pair across dashboard, alert, and access, and the shared help/error output no longer mixes canonical and legacy spellings.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Remove Python Auth Legacy Aliases
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_auth_staging.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python dashboard, alert, and access CLIs still accepted legacy Basic-auth aliases `--username` and `--password` alongside `--basic-user` and `--basic-password`. That made the help text noisier and left a naming collision with business flags such as `access user add --password`.
- Current Update: Removed the Python CLI parser aliases for `--username` and auth `--password`, updated shared auth error wording to mention only `--basic-user` and `--basic-password`, refreshed parser/auth tests to assert the new contract, and trimmed the README auth section to the new flag vocabulary.
- Result: Python CLI Basic auth now uses one unambiguous flag pair, `--basic-user` and `--basic-password`, while business flags such as `access user add --password` keep their existing meaning.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Resolve Rust Access Password Flag Collision
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust access CLI reused the common Basic-auth legacy alias `--password` while `access user add` also defined `--password` for the new user's local password. Clap tolerated normal parsing in some paths, but long-help rendering for `access user add` failed with a duplicate long-option panic.
- Current Update: Removed the Rust access common-auth `--password` legacy alias, kept `--basic-password` as the supported Basic-auth flag for that CLI family, and re-enabled focused help coverage for `access user add` so the collision stays fixed.
- Result: `cargo run --quiet --bin grafana-utils -- access user add -h` and the corresponding test help paths now work again, while the user-creation password flag keeps its existing `--password` spelling.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Consolidate Python CLI Auth Error Resolution
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_auth_staging.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python dashboard, alert, and access CLIs already delegated the raw token-vs-Basic auth decision to `auth_staging.resolve_auth_from_namespace()`, but each CLI still carried its own copy of the same `AuthConfigError` to operator-facing `GrafanaError` message mapping. That left three near-identical `resolve_auth()` implementations to keep in sync whenever auth wording changed.
- Current Update: Added shared CLI-facing auth error formatting and a `resolve_cli_auth_from_namespace()` helper in `auth_staging.py`, then rewired the dashboard, alert, and access CLIs to use that shared helper while preserving each module's existing `GrafanaError` wrapper and return shape.
- Result: Python auth resolution now has one shared source of truth for CLI-facing error wording across dashboard, alert, and access commands, which removes duplicated message-mapping logic without changing the operator-visible auth behavior.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Fill Rust Access CLI Help Text
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust access CLI already exposed a broad user/team/service-account command surface, but many `--...` flags in `access_cli_defs.rs` still relied on bare `#[arg(long)]` declarations with no operator-facing help text. That made `-h` output inconsistent with the more fully described dashboard, datasource, and alert command families.
- Current Update: Added concrete help text for the previously bare access list, add, modify, delete, and token-creation flags, and added focused help-output tests so the most important user/team/service-account subcommands now assert the presence of those descriptions.
- Result: Rust access `-h` output is now much closer to the rest of the repo: most operator-facing flags explain what they target, what they filter, or what they change instead of only listing the flag names.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Import Dry-Run Output Columns
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard and datasource import dry-run output could now be switched between text, table, and JSON, but the table view still had a fixed column set. Dashboard table output also carried newer folder-match details in the record flow without giving operators a way to narrow the rendered columns to the fields they actually needed for review.
- Current Update: Added `--output-columns` for dashboard and datasource import dry-run table output in Python and Rust, normalized the supported column ids and aliases, kept the default tables unchanged when the flag is omitted, and tightened validation so the selector is only accepted together with table-like dry-run output.
- Result: Operators can now trim import dry-run tables down to the specific fields they care about, such as `uid,action,file` for datasource review or `uid,source_folder_path,destination_folder_path,reason` for dashboard folder-mismatch review, while the existing default summaries still render exactly as before.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Trim Dashboard CLI Compatibility Wrappers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_runtime.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_integration_flow.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the export/import/inspection/diff runtime splits and the dashboard test decoupling work, `dashboard_cli.py` still carried a large block of thin compatibility wrappers for output support, export inventory, folder inventory, listing helpers, and inspection materialization. Most of those names no longer had active runtime or test callers, but they still kept the CLI facade larger and harder to reason about.
- Current Update: Removed the now-unused wrapper layer from `dashboard_cli.py`, rewired import and diff dependency assembly to call canonical helper modules directly, and kept only the real CLI entrypoints plus dependency-bundle factories in the facade.
- Result: `dashboard_cli.py` is now much closer to a true CLI facade instead of a mixed facade-and-helper module, and the remaining dashboard helper logic now lives in the dedicated `grafana_utils.dashboards.*` modules where it belongs.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Decouple Dashboard Tests From CLI Compatibility Wrappers
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_integration_flow.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard Python test suites still reached many helper functions through `grafana_utils.dashboard_cli`, including output-support, export-inventory, folder-inventory, and listing helpers whose real implementations now live under `grafana_utils.dashboards.*`. That meant the remaining compatibility wrappers in `dashboard_cli.py` were still pinned in place by tests even after the workflow/runtime wiring had moved out.
- Current Update: Repointed the dashboard test helpers and fixtures to the canonical `grafana_utils.dashboards.*` modules for export metadata, output-path builders, export inventory discovery/validation, folder inventory loading, dashboard write helpers, and datasource-source attachment. Kept `dashboard_cli` itself for real CLI entrypoint coverage, but stopped using its wrapper surface for fixture construction and helper-unit assertions.
- Result: The dashboard Python tests now validate the real helper modules directly instead of indirectly through `dashboard_cli` compatibility wrappers, which clears the way for later cleanup of that facade without losing behavior coverage.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Import Runtime Wiring
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_runtime.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import already had a dedicated `import_workflow.py` module, but `dashboard_cli.py` still assembled the full import dependency map locally and therefore kept another large import-only runtime wiring block in the CLI facade. The CLI still needed to preserve its public helper surface, but the import workflow did not need to depend on that local assembly directly.
- Current Update: Added `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_runtime.py` to own the import dependency-map assembly and rewired `dashboard_cli._build_import_workflow_deps()` to delegate through that runtime helper while preserving the existing `dashboard_cli` entrypoints and helper names.
- Result: Python dashboard import runtime wiring now sits in a dedicated helper module instead of in the CLI facade, which trims another large behavior-preserving dependency bundle out of `dashboard_cli.py` without changing import behavior or the public helper names used by tests.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Unify Output Format Flags
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo currently uses `--table` in multiple incompatible ways: sometimes as the default list output, sometimes as a dry-run mode switch, and dashboard inspect already has a separate `--output-format` selector. That makes operators guess whether `--table` is redundant, required, or unsupported depending on the command family.
- Current Update: Added a consistent `--output-format` selector across the existing table/csv/json-like command families without changing current defaults, kept the legacy flags working as compatibility aliases, and documented the new single-flag path in the READMEs.
- Result: Python and Rust now both accept `--output-format` for access list, alert list, dashboard list, dashboard datasource list, datasource list, and the dashboard/datasource import dry-run summaries. Mixed use with old selector flags now fails cleanly, but existing defaults and old flags continue working unchanged.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Export Runtime Wiring
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_runtime.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard export already had a dedicated `export_workflow.py` module, but `dashboard_cli.py` still assembled the full export dependency map locally and therefore kept a large cluster of export-only runtime wiring in the CLI facade. The public helper names in `dashboard_cli.py` still needed to stay available for compatibility and tests, but the export workflow did not need to depend on those local wrappers directly.
- Current Update: Added `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_runtime.py` to own the export dependency-map assembly and rewired `dashboard_cli._build_export_workflow_deps()` to delegate through that runtime helper while keeping the existing `dashboard_cli` helper surface stable.
- Result: Python dashboard export runtime wiring now sits in a dedicated helper module instead of inside the CLI facade, which trims another large behavior-preserving dependency bundle out of `dashboard_cli.py` without changing export behavior or the public helper names used by tests.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Wire Datasource Diff CLI
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/datasource_diff.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_diff.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource diff scaffolds now exist in standalone Python and Rust files, but neither runtime exposes a `datasource diff` subcommand yet. The unified CLIs, operator help, and crate test graph still describe datasource as `list/export/import` only, so the new compare logic is unreachable.
- Current Update: Wired both runtimes to expose datasource diff through the existing datasource namespace, kept the compare helpers as the implementation base, extended focused parser/help/behavior coverage, and updated the README datasource command summaries so operator docs no longer claim datasource only supports list/export/import.
- Result: `grafana-utils datasource diff --diff-dir ...` now works in both Python and Rust, unified CLI help exposes the new subcommand, Python prints per-item unified diffs for changed datasource records, Rust returns a non-zero CLI result when differences are found, and the previously standalone Rust diff scaffold is now part of the crate test graph.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Inspection Runtime Wiring
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_runtime.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection already has dedicated workflow, summary, report, and governance modules, but `dashboard_cli.py` still assembles a large inspection dependency map and owns a local `iter_dashboard_panels()` helper just to feed those modules. That leaves too much inspection runtime wiring in the CLI facade even after the earlier dashboard refactors.
- Current Update: Added `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_runtime.py` to own the inspection dependency-map assembly and moved `iter_dashboard_panels()` there. Updated `inspection_workflow.py` to own its own `json`/`sys`/`tempfile` usage and to call `run_inspect_export()` directly for live inspection instead of routing back through a CLI callback.
- Result: `dashboard_cli.py` now delegates the inspection runtime wiring to a dedicated helper module and keeps only thin compatibility wrappers for inspection entrypoints, which reduces the remaining inspection-specific bulk in the CLI facade without changing the public CLI surface.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Export Org Resolution
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import already delegates most raw-export file discovery and manifest validation to `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, but `dashboard_cli.py` still owns the separate `resolve_export_org_id()` scan that walks raw `index.json`, `folders.json`, and `datasources.json` directly. That leaves one more raw-export inventory concern in the CLI facade even though the surrounding metadata helpers have already moved out.
- Current Update: Moved `resolve_export_org_id()` into `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py` and rewired the CLI wrapper to delegate through that module, keeping the existing wrapper signature and import-org-guard behavior intact.
- Result: Raw export metadata resolution now lives with the other export inventory helpers instead of inside the dashboard CLI facade, which further narrows `dashboard_cli.py` toward parser and wiring ownership.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Diff Workflow
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/diff_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python dashboard export, import, and inspection already delegate their main orchestration into dedicated `grafana_utils/dashboards/*_workflow.py` modules, but `dashboard_cli.py` still owns the remaining dashboard diff loop directly. That keeps one more live orchestration path coupled to the CLI facade even though the rest of the dashboard runtime has mostly been split by responsibility.
- Current Update: Moved the dashboard diff compare loop into a new `grafana_utils/dashboards/diff_workflow.py` module and rewired `dashboard_cli.diff_dashboards()` to delegate through a focused dependency bundle, matching the existing export/import/inspection workflow pattern.
- Result: Python dashboard diff now follows the same orchestration split as the other major dashboard flows, and `dashboard_cli.py` keeps only the stable CLI wrapper/dependency wiring for diff instead of the full compare loop.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Consolidate Shared Python Auth Helper
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python dashboard and alert CLIs still each carried their own inline token-vs-Basic auth resolution logic even though `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py` already existed and access had started delegating through it. The auth rules matched, but operator-facing error wording still lived separately inside each CLI.
- Current Update: Rewired `dashboard_cli.py` and `alert_cli.py` to resolve auth through the shared staging helper while preserving each CLI's existing auth error messages and prompt behavior. Extended focused dashboard and alert auth tests to cover the shared helper path plus env-backed and partial-env validation.
- Result: All three Python CLI families now share one auth-resolution implementation path, while dashboard and alert keep their established CLI-facing validation text and auth fallback behavior.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Wire Quality Gate Scripts
- State: Done
- Scope: `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/check-quality.sh`, `scripts/check-python-quality.sh`, `scripts/check-rust-quality.sh`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had staged quality scripts, but `make quality` still expanded directly to hard-coded test/fmt/clippy targets and CI still duplicated that logic as separate workflow steps. The new scripts existed only as unattached assets, so local and CI quality behavior could drift again.
- Current Update: Wired `make quality`, `make quality-python`, and `make quality-rust` to the staged scripts, and updated CI to call those targets directly instead of re-declaring the checks inline. Updated maintainer and user docs to describe the new script-backed quality gate path and the optional-tool skip behavior.
- Result: Local `make` entrypoints and CI now share the same quality gate scripts, so future gate changes can happen in one place instead of being duplicated across shell, Makefile, and workflow YAML.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Finish Access Delete Commands And Group Alias
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/auth_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/access/pending_cli_staging.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_pending_delete.rs`, `rust/src/access_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The access CLI already handled user CRUD, team list/add/modify, and service-account list/add/token-add, but `team delete`, `service-account delete`, `service-account token delete`, and the `group` compatibility alias were still unfinished. Access auth resolution also still carried its own inline implementation instead of delegating to the new shared staging helper.
- Current Update: Wired the shared Python auth helper into `access_cli.py` while preserving the existing access-facing error text, added Python and Rust parser/dispatch/client support for `team delete`, `service-account delete`, and `service-account token delete`, and exposed `group` as a compatibility alias for `team`. Extended focused Python and Rust access tests around the new destructive flows and alias parsing.
- Result: Both runtimes now expose the full planned access command surface except for the still-unimplemented shared TLS flags, and the Python access CLI no longer owns a private copy of the token-vs-Basic auth resolution logic.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Actionable Governance Risk Metadata
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_governance.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_governance_render.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_governance.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Governance reports in both Python and Rust already exposed `kind`, `severity`, `datasource`, and `detail`, but operators still had to infer whether a finding was inventory drift, analyzer coverage debt, or datasource topology risk, and there was no stable remediation hint for automation to consume.
- Current Update: Added additive `category` and `recommendation` fields to governance `riskRecords` in both Python and Rust for the four current governance risk kinds: `mixed-datasource-dashboard`, `orphaned-datasource`, `unknown-datasource-family`, and `empty-query-analysis`. Updated the governance table renderers so the risk section now shows those fields directly, and extended focused Python and Rust governance tests to lock the new JSON/table contract.
- Result: Governance JSON now carries a stable actionability layer for follow-up tooling, and governance table output is more operator-actionable without changing report flags or removing any existing fields.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Export-Org Guard
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import already respected the active token org or explicit `--org-id`, but it did not warn or fail when a raw export from one org was replayed into a different target org. The raw export inventory recorded `orgId`, yet import treated that metadata as informational only.
- Current Update: Added opt-in `--require-matching-export-org` to Python and Rust dashboard import. The new guard resolves one stable source export `orgId` from raw metadata files, resolves the target org from `--org-id` or the active current-org lookup, and fails early when those org IDs differ or when the raw export does not provide one stable source org.
- Result: Operators can now keep token-based current-org import behavior by default, but they can also enable an explicit safety check that blocks accidental cross-org dry-runs or live imports.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Wire Inspection Governance Reports
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_governance.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_governance_render.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_governance.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_governance.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python had standalone governance builder/render helper modules available locally but no CLI wiring, while Rust inspection still exposed only the existing summary, flat query report, CSV, tree, and tree-table paths with no governance-focused report model at all. Operators could not yet request governance-focused table or JSON output through either inspection CLI, and `--report-columns` validation had no governance-specific guard.
- Current Update: Added `--report governance` and `--report governance-json` to both Python and Rust inspection CLI help/choices, wired each inspection workflow to build governance output from the existing summary document plus the datasource/panel-filtered per-query report document, and kept datasource/panel filtering applied at the report-document layer before governance aggregation. Python now owns dedicated governance builder/render modules; Rust now owns a dedicated `dashboard_inspect_governance.rs` module with governance document and table rendering helpers. Added focused parser/output/validation coverage on both runtimes.
- Result: Both Python and Rust inspection paths now expose governance-focused table and JSON report modes through `inspect-export` and `inspect-live`, while keeping governance aggregation isolated behind dedicated builder/render ownership instead of spreading the logic through the older summary/report paths.
## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Org Scoping
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard list and export already supported explicit org switching through `--org-id` and used a Basic-auth-only org-scoped client model, but dashboard import still always ran in the current org context. Raw exports recorded `org` and `orgId`, yet import had no way to target one explicit destination org for the whole run.
- Current Update: Added `--org-id` to both Python and Rust dashboard import flows. The new flag scopes the entire import run, including dry-run checks and live writes, to one explicit destination Grafana org, requires Basic auth, and keeps raw export `orgId` metadata as informational only rather than automatic routing input.
- Result: Operators can now re-import one raw dashboard batch directly into a chosen Grafana org without manually switching org context first, while preserving the existing import behavior when `--org-id` is not set.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Dashboard Import Folder-Path Guard
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/folder_path_match.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/progress.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_folder_path_match.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import already supported create-only, create-or-update, and update-or-skip-missing modes keyed by dashboard `uid`, but it had no way to protect existing dashboards that had drifted into a different destination folder path. Operators could preserve or override destination folder UIDs, but they could not require the exported raw folder path to match the current Grafana folder path before updating an existing dashboard.
- Current Update: Added `--require-matching-folder-path` in both Python and Rust dashboard import flows. The new guard compares the raw source folder path against the current destination Grafana folder path only for existing dashboards, rewrites update actions to `skip-folder-mismatch` when those paths differ, extends dry-run table/json output with source and destination folder-path columns/details, and rejects the guard when combined with `--import-folder-uid`.
- Result: Operators can now keep the existing batch import workflow while safely blocking updates to dashboards that have moved to a different folder path in the target Grafana, and they can see the exact source/destination path mismatch in dry-run output before running a live import.

## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Loki Inspection Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect_analyzer_loki.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `fixtures/dashboard_inspection_analyzer_cases.json`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Loki inspection already had its own analyzer boundary, but the Rust contract still stopped at selectors, label matchers, and generic pipeline names. That left obvious LogQL filter intent less visible in the report rows, especially for `|=` and `|~` style pipeline filters.
- Current Update: Added conservative Loki line-filter hints to the existing `functions` field, kept the stream-selector scanner quote-aware so `line_format` templates do not become fake selectors, and expanded the shared fixture plus report-level Rust coverage to pin the richer Loki row shape.
- Result: Loki inspection rows now expose a clearer operator-facing LogQL shape without widening the report schema or attempting a full parser.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Strengthen Loki Inspection Analyzers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/loki.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_analyzer_loki.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Loki already had dedicated analyzer boundaries in both Python and Rust, but Python still returned an empty placeholder analysis and Rust did not yet extract Loki-specific inspection signals beyond the generic report flow. That left Loki inspection rows structurally present but materially less informative than Prometheus, Flux, or SQL rows.
- Current Update: Implemented conservative Loki heuristics in both runtimes. Python now extracts stream matchers into `measurements` and common LogQL range/aggregation functions plus pipeline/filter stages into `metrics` without widening the existing report contract. Rust now extracts stream selectors, label matchers, common functions/stages, and range windows into the existing `metrics` / `measurements` / `buckets` fields, with focused regression coverage for a real Loki query fixture.
- Result: Loki inspection rows now expose useful best-effort query signals in both Python and Rust while preserving the established inspection schema and keeping future Loki refinement isolated behind dedicated analyzer modules.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Inspection Renderers
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_render.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust already had separate inspection report-model and analyzer modules, but `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs` still owned the shared CSV/table rendering helpers plus the grouped tree and tree-table report renderers. That kept inspection orchestration and output formatting coupled in one large Rust module even after earlier inspection splits.
- Current Update: Extracted the Rust inspection CSV/table/tree/tree-table renderers into `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_render.rs`, rewired `rust/src/dashboard.rs` to re-export the renderer helpers, and updated `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs` to consume the new renderer boundary without changing CLI/help/output behavior.
- Result: Rust inspection now has a clearer three-way ownership split across orchestration (`dashboard_inspect.rs`), report-model helpers (`dashboard_inspect_report.rs`), and renderers (`dashboard_inspect_render.rs`), which is closer to the current Python structure.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Loki And Generic Inspection Analyzers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/__init__.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/dispatcher.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/generic.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/loki.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the Prometheus / Flux / SQL analyzer split, `inspection_analyzers/` still lacked a real explicit fallback boundary and Loki analysis was only represented by an empty placeholder. That left the analyzer package incomplete even though `inspection_report.py` was already dispatching through it.
- Current Update: Added an explicit `generic` analyzer module, wired unknown datasource families through it in the dispatcher, and kept Loki analysis behind its own dedicated analyzer boundary. Added focused syntax and dispatcher coverage for the new generic path and preserved the existing Loki/generic inspection contract expectations in the dashboard CLI suite.
- Result: The Python inspection analyzer package now has an explicit ownership path for every routed datasource family, including Loki and the generic fallback, so future family-specific work can keep shrinking `inspection_report.py` without routing unknown cases back through the report layer.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Inspection Analyzers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/contract.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/prometheus.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/flux.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_analyzers/sql.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py` still carried datasource-family dispatch plus Prometheus, Flux, and SQL-specific query heuristics inline even after the renderer split. The `inspection_analyzers/` package existed, but most of the real family-specific logic still lived in the report module instead of behind the analyzer boundary.
- Current Update: Moved the active Prometheus, Flux, and SQL query-analysis heuristics into `inspection_analyzers/` and rewired `inspection_report.py` to use `dispatch_query_analysis()` plus the shared `build_query_field_and_text()` helper from the analyzer package. Added focused dashboard CLI coverage for one mixed Prometheus/Flux/SQL report JSON fixture so the analyzer split keeps the current inspection contract and values stable.
- Result: Python inspection analysis is now actually decomposed by datasource family instead of only having a placeholder analyzer package, while `inspection_report.py` focuses more narrowly on row/document construction and preserves the existing CLI/report surface.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Inspection Renderers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_render.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_summary.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py` still mixed the canonical inspection document builders with CSV/table/tree/tree-table output rendering. That kept report modeling and output formatting coupled inside one 1100+ line module even after earlier dashboard facade reductions, and the focused CLI suite did not yet pin the `inspect-export --json` or `inspect-export --report json` output contracts.
- Current Update: Extracted the inspection report render helpers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_render.py` and rewired `inspection_report.py` to re-export the stable renderer names already used by `dashboard_cli.py` and the inspection workflow dependency bundle. `inspection_summary.py` now imports the shared table-section helper from the renderer module directly. Added Python 3.6 syntax coverage for the new module, kept the grouped tree-table renderer test, and added focused execution coverage for `inspect-export --json` plus `inspect-export --report json`.
- Result: Python dashboard inspection now has a clearer boundary between report document building and output rendering, while the existing CLI wiring and helper surface stay behavior-compatible and the inspect JSON contracts are now covered before deeper analyzer refactors.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Output Support Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/output_support.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the progress, folder-support, and import-support splits, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` still kept the remaining export/output path builders, file-write helpers, and export index/metadata builders inline. That left one cohesive export-support block in the facade even though the Rust-side structure already treats those responsibilities as helper-owned instead of top-level CLI-owned.
- Current Update: Extracted the Python dashboard export/output helper cluster into `grafana_utils/dashboards/output_support.py` and rewired `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` to import and re-export the stable helper names used by tests and workflow dependency bundles. Added Python 3.6 syntax coverage for the new output-support module in the dashboard CLI test suite.
- Result: The Python dashboard facade is now closer to a parser/dispatch/dependency-bundle host, while output-path generation, export manifest/index construction, and JSON/dashboard file writes live behind a focused helper boundary.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Progress Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/progress.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the listing, import/diff, and folder-support splits, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` was already much smaller but still kept the remaining export/import progress rendering helpers inline. That left one small but cohesive output-formatting block in the facade instead of with other focused helper modules.
- Current Update: Extracted the dashboard export/import progress renderers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/progress.py` and rewired `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` to import and re-export the same helper names used by the workflow dependency bundles. Added Python 3.6 syntax coverage for the new progress helper module.
- Result: The Python dashboard facade is now closer to a pure parser/dispatch/dependency-bundle host, while progress output behavior stays unchanged for export and import workflows.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Folder Support Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/folder_support.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` had already shed listing, import/diff helpers, and workflow bodies, but it still kept the remaining folder inventory collection, live folder status checks, export-manifest wrapper loads, and import-folder path resolution logic inline. That left one large folder-oriented helper block in the facade instead of behind a focused Python module matching the Rust split direction.
- Current Update: Extracted the folder inventory and import-folder helper cluster into `grafana_utils/dashboards/folder_support.py` and rewired `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` to import and re-export the stable helper names used by tests and workflows. Added Python 3.6 syntax coverage for both extracted helper modules so the reduced facade and new helper files stay parseable under the repo's compatibility target.
- Result: The Python dashboard facade now carries less folder-specific plumbing, helper ownership is closer to the Rust dashboard split without changing Rust itself, and the existing `grafana_utils.dashboard_cli` helper surface remains behavior-compatible for callers and tests.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Import Diff Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` had already moved high-level import orchestration into `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, but the facade still owned the low-level import payload parsing, export-manifest validation wrappers, dry-run renderers, and diff comparison helpers in one large inline block. That kept import/diff-specific logic mixed into the top-level dashboard CLI module even after earlier workflow and listing splits.
- Current Update: Extracted the import/diff helper cluster into `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_support.py` and rewired `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` to import and re-export the stable helper surface used by the CLI workflows and tests. The refactor also drops the duplicate local `build_preserved_web_import_document()` implementation in favor of the existing transformer helper.
- Result: The Python dashboard facade carries less import/diff plumbing, helper ownership is more explicit for future dashboard complexity reduction work, and the public `grafana_utils.dashboard_cli` helper surface remains behavior-compatible for tests and callers.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Listing Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/listing.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` had already shed export/import/inspection responsibilities, but live dashboard listing, datasource-list rendering, and dashboard datasource-source enrichment still lived inline in the main CLI facade. That left one large block mixing list command orchestration, table/CSV/JSON renderers, and datasource lookup helpers in the same file as unrelated dashboard flows.
- Current Update: Extracted the live dashboard/datasource listing helpers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/listing.py`, including table/CSV/JSON renderers, folder-path/org/source enrichment, datasource UID/name resolution, and the two list command bodies. `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` now re-exports the existing helper names and delegates `list-dashboard` / `list-data-sources` through the extracted module so the stable test and CLI surface stays intact.
- Result: The Python dashboard facade carries less list-specific logic, the list responsibilities now live behind a focused helper boundary similar to Rust `dashboard_list.rs`, and operator-facing behavior stays unchanged.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Inspect Output Format Alias
- State: In Progress
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspect output was split across legacy `--json` / `--table` summary flags plus `--report[=...]` for query-level/governance modes, which made the output contract harder to remember and explain.
- Current Update: Added `--output-format` to both `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` as a single explicit selector for `text`, `table`, `json`, `report-*`, and governance modes, while preserving the older flags for compatibility and rejecting mixed selector combinations.
- Result: Inspect output can now be requested with one clearer flag without removing old CLI spellings. The remaining work is keeping docs/examples biased toward `--output-format` over time.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Datasource Inventory CLI
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo only exposed live datasource inventory through `grafana-utils dashboard list-data-sources`, so datasource state still lived as a dashboard-adjacent helper instead of a first-class CLI surface and there was no standalone datasource export contract yet.
- Current Update: Added a Python `grafana-utils datasource` entrypoint with `list` and `export` subcommands, kept `dashboard list-data-sources` unchanged as a compatibility path, and defined a minimal datasource export root that writes normalized `datasources.json`, `index.json`, and `export-metadata.json` files for the current org.
- Result: Datasource inventory is now available through a dedicated Python CLI surface without broad import/update semantics yet. The main remaining gaps are the later roadmap items: multi-org datasource workflows plus import/diff support and Python/Rust parity for the new resource family.

## 2026-03-14 - Task: Add Datasource Import
- State: In Progress
- Scope: `grafana_utils/datasource_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource inventory could be listed and exported, but there was still no supported path to replay the normalized datasource contract back into Grafana, no dry-run for datasource imports, and no Rust datasource namespace in the unified CLI.
- Current Update: Added first-pass datasource import in both Python and Rust with dry-run/table/JSON output, explicit `--org-id` import scoping, opt-in `--require-matching-export-org`, and create/update/update-existing-only reconciliation using live datasource `uid` then exact `name` matching.
- Result: Datasource export now round-trips through a guarded import workflow on both runtimes. The main remaining gaps are secret-bearing datasource settings, broader conflict/mapping controls, and live Docker validation similar to dashboard import.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Flux And SQL Dashboard Inspection Extraction
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection already exposed one stable per-query report contract, but Flux extraction only covered `_measurement`/`bucket` heuristics and SQL-family queries still fell back to the generic token extractor, so table/source references and coarse query shape were not surfaced usefully.
- Current Update: Kept the shared report contract unchanged and added conservative Flux/SQL-family extraction on both implementations. Flux now maps pipeline/source function names into `metrics` while keeping `_measurement` values in `measurements` and `bucket` values in `buckets`. SQL-family queries now map coarse query-shape hints into `metrics`, table/source references into `measurements`, and leave `buckets` empty because the current contract does not expose dedicated SQL fields.
- Result: Inspect report rows stay schema-compatible, but Flux and SQL-family dashboards now produce more useful best-effort extraction without widening CLI/report scope. The main remaining constraint is contractual: table refs, query-shape hints, and Flux pipeline stages still share the existing generic list fields instead of dedicated report columns.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Dashboard Export Inventory Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_files.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Even after the earlier workflow and inspection splits, the dashboard facades still kept raw-export file discovery, folder/datasource inventory loading, and export metadata validation inline, so both Python and Rust entry modules still mixed low-level filesystem concerns with higher-level orchestration.
- Current Update: Extracted the remaining Python raw-export helpers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_inventory.py`, routed the Python facade through those helpers, and kept the Rust side aligned by moving the matching helper ownership under `rust/src/dashboard_files.rs` behind the existing `dashboard.rs` re-export surface.
- Result: The Python and Rust dashboard facades now carry less raw-export plumbing, which reduces the chance that future inspect/import changes re-entangle file inventory logic with top-level CLI orchestration. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`, and `make quality`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Inspection Summary Internals
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_summary.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the inspection report split, `dashboard_cli.py` still kept the higher-level inspection summary document builder and summary/table renderers inline, so the Python inspection surface was still only partially decomposed and the summary-focused tests still lived in the broader dashboard CLI suite.
- Current Update: Extracted the summary document builder plus summary/table renderers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_summary.py`, routed `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` through that module using the existing inspection dependency bundle, and moved the summary-specific inspection behavior tests into `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`.
- Result: Python dashboard inspection now has a clearer internal boundary between summary inspection and per-query reporting, and `dashboard_cli.py` shrank again without changing operator-facing behavior. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Stabilize Dashboard Inspection Report Internals
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_report.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the earlier dashboard workflow split, inspection was still the path most likely to re-tangle. Python still mixed report constants/row normalization/rendering into the CLI surface, Rust still kept most inspection report model helpers inside the broader dashboard modules, and the Python inspection-heavy tests were still largely concentrated in the main dashboard CLI test file.
- Current Update: Centralized the Python inspection report contract in `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_report.py`, moved the inspection-heavy Python behavior coverage into `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, and split the Rust inspection report model/column contract into `rust/src/dashboard_inspect_report.rs` so both implementations now route flat/tree/tree-table output through a narrower dedicated inspection-report layer.
- Result: Dashboard inspection behavior stays unchanged for operators, but the canonical inspection model is now much more explicit in both implementations and the Python inspection tests are no longer piled into one giant dashboard CLI file. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`, and `make quality`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Full Inspect Help For Dashboard CLI
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-utils.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` help output stayed concise, but operators had no built-in way to ask either CLI for a richer inspect-specific examples block covering report modes like `tree-table`, filters, and `--report-columns`.
- Current Update: Added `--help-full` for `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` in both Python and Rust. The new flag prints the normal subcommand help first, then appends a short extended examples section focused on report modes, datasource/panel filters, and column trimming. Normal `-h/--help` remains unchanged.
- Result: Inspect users can now ask either CLI for richer examples without making standard help noisier. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py` and `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Refine Python Tree-Table Dashboard Inspect Report
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had a `tree-table` trace entry, but this Python task specifically needed the Python CLI/parser/docs/tests to accept `tree-table`, honor `--report-columns`, and keep the existing flat and tree modes unchanged without touching Rust files.
- Current Update: Added Python `tree-table` support to the `inspect-export` and `inspect-live` `--report` choices, allowed `--report-columns` for that mode, and rendered grouped dashboard-first sections with one per-dashboard query table using the filtered flat query-record model.
- Result: Python operators can now use `--report tree-table` with either default or custom columns, while `table`, `csv`, `json`, and `tree` behavior remains intact. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Tree Dashboard Inspect Report
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection could already emit either a high-level summary or a flat row-per-query report through `inspect-export --report` / `inspect-live --report`, but operators had to scan a wide flat table or JSON array when they wanted to read one dashboard at a time.
- Current Update: Added a `--report tree` mode for both Python and Rust `inspect-export` and `inspect-live`. The new mode keeps the existing flat report model as the source of truth, applies the existing datasource and panel-id filters first, then renders the filtered records as a dashboard -> panel -> query tree without changing the existing flat `table`, `csv`, or `json` report contracts.
- Result: Operators can now inspect dashboard exports or live dashboards in a hierarchy that mirrors how Grafana is read in practice, while existing flat report automation remains unchanged. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py` and `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Tree-Table Dashboard Inspect Report
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `--report tree` improved readability for dashboard-first inspection, but it intentionally rendered free-form text lines instead of preserving a columnar view. Operators who wanted dashboard-first grouping still had to switch back to the flat table when they needed aligned columns.
- Current Update: Added `--report tree-table` for both Python and Rust `inspect-export` and `inspect-live`. The new mode keeps the same filtered flat query-record model as the source of truth, groups rows by dashboard, then renders one compact table per dashboard section. `--report-columns` now also applies to `tree-table`, and Python `--no-header` handling now treats `tree-table` as a supported table-like mode.
- Result: Operators can inspect one dashboard at a time without giving up column alignment. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`, `python3 python/grafana-utils.py dashboard inspect-export --help`, and `cargo run --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet --bin grafana-utils -- dashboard inspect-export --help`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Basic Quality Gates
- State: Done
- Scope: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo had strong unit test coverage, but quality enforcement still depended on developers manually running local commands. There was no checked-in CI workflow and no shared shortcut that matched the repo's baseline automated gates.
- Current Update: Added a baseline GitHub Actions workflow with separate Python and Rust jobs, and introduced `make quality`, `make fmt-rust-check`, and `make lint-rust` so local and CI checks use the same entrypoints. The first baseline intentionally stays pragmatic: Python unit tests plus Rust tests, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- Result: The repo now has a minimum automated quality gate instead of relying only on local discipline, and maintainers have one documented local command that matches the CI baseline. Validation passed with `make quality`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Orchestration Modules
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` had regrown past 3000 lines and still mixed shared types/helpers with import/diff orchestration plus inspect-export/inspect-live analysis and rendering. The Rust dashboard surface was behaviorally healthy again, but the main module had resumed accumulating too many responsibilities.
- Current Update: Extracted import and diff orchestration into `rust/src/dashboard_import.rs`, moved inspect-export and inspect-live analysis/rendering into `rust/src/dashboard_inspect.rs`, and kept the `crate::dashboard` API stable through targeted re-exports used by the CLI paths and tests. The remaining `rust/src/dashboard.rs` now focuses more clearly on shared types/helpers plus top-level entrypoints.
- Result: The Rust dashboard implementation is materially easier to evolve: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` dropped to roughly 1287 lines, while import/diff and inspect/live flows now live in dedicated modules without changing operator-facing behavior. Validation passed with `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet` and `make quality`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Orchestration Modules
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/__init__.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` has grown into a 3700+ line module that still mixes CLI parsing, rendering helpers, data-shape helpers, and the high-level export/import/inspect orchestration flows in one file. The Python dashboard path works, but the orchestration layer is harder to change safely than the already-split Rust implementation.
- Current Update: Extracted the high-level Python dashboard export, import, and inspection workflow bodies into `grafana_utils/dashboards/export_workflow.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/import_workflow.py`, and `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`. `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` now delegates through explicit dependency bundles so the existing CLI entrypoints, shared helpers, and direct test imports stay stable while the main module shrinks materially.
- Result: The Python dashboard CLI keeps the same operator-facing behavior, but its top-level module is smaller and future workflow changes can now land in focused orchestration modules instead of growing one file. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Inspect Export Orphaned Datasources
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_summary.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `inspect-export` already surfaced datasource inventory records with per-datasource reference and dashboard counts, but operators still had to scan the whole inventory manually to spot datasources that were exported yet unused by any dashboard.
- Current Update: Added explicit orphaned-datasource accounting to the Python inspection summary path so `inspect-export` now records `orphanedDatasourceCount`, exposes `orphanedDatasources` in JSON output, and renders a dedicated orphaned-datasource section in both the human summary and `--table` output.
- Result: Operators can now identify unused exported datasources directly from the inspection summary without scripting against the inventory rows or manually filtering for zero-reference entries.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Dashboard Inspect Live Command
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard inspection currently requires a raw export directory on disk via `inspect-export`. Operators can inspect exported data offline, but there is no direct live Grafana inspection command that reuses the same summary/report output contract.
- Current Update: Added an `inspect-live` dashboard subcommand in both Python and Rust that accepts live auth/common args plus `inspect-export`-style summary/report flags, materializes a temporary raw-export-like layout from live dashboards, folders, and datasources, and then reuses the existing `inspect-export` analysis/rendering pipeline. Added parser/help coverage and focused report-path tests, then updated the public and maintainer docs.
- Result: Operators can now inspect live Grafana dashboards with the same summary/report surface they already use for raw export directories, without manually running export first. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Inspect Report Datasource UID
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `inspect-export --report` already carried datasource labels, but JSON rows did not expose datasource UIDs and the table/CSV column contract had no way to opt them in without widening the default report layout.
- Current Update: Added best-effort `datasourceUid` to the per-query inspection row model, kept it in JSON report output by default, and exposed it as an opt-in `datasource_uid` column for table/CSV output so the common default report shape stays unchanged. The CLI help and docs now describe that split behavior.
- Result: Operators can now script against datasource UIDs from JSON output immediately, while table and CSV users can request `datasource_uid` only when they need it. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py` and `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Dashboard Inspect Query Report
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `inspect-export` could summarize dashboard, folder, panel, query, and datasource counts plus mixed-datasource usage, but it did not emit one per-target query report and did not extract metric-like identifiers from query expressions for table or JSON inspection output.
- Current Update: Added `inspect-export --report[=table|json]` in both Python and Rust, built a per-query offline inspection model with dashboard/panel/datasource/query context, extracted heuristic `metrics`, `measurements`, and `buckets`, added `--report-columns`, `--report-filter-datasource`, and `--report-filter-panel-id` for narrower operator workflows, aligned the new flags in docs, and noted that future parser growth should stay split by datasource family.
- Result: Operators can now inspect exported dashboards at query-target granularity from raw export directories, use table output by default or JSON for downstream analysis, narrow the report to one datasource or one panel id, and trim table output to selected columns. Validation passed with `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `cargo test dashboard --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --quiet`, and real sample runs against `tmp/recheck-export-20260313/raw`.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Tighten Dashboard Typed Records And Integration Coverage
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/common.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_integration_flow.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_prompt.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_list.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard code still repeated fallback literals such as `General`, `Main Org.`, and `unknown` across Python export/import/inspect flows, Rust prompt export still passed datasource catalogs around as anonymous tuple maps, and the Python dashboard suite mostly validated helpers in isolation rather than one end-to-end raw-export inspection and dry-run import flow.
- Current Update: Extracted shared Python dashboard fallback constants into `grafana_utils/dashboards/common.py`, updated dashboard summary and export/import inspection paths to reuse them, replaced Rust's tuple-shaped datasource catalog with a named `DatasourceCatalog { by_uid, by_name }`, and added focused Python integration-style tests for offline `inspect-export --json` plus `import-dashboard --dry-run --json --ensure-folders`.
- Result: Dashboard fallback behavior is easier to keep consistent, Rust datasource resolution now has a typed boundary instead of anonymous paired maps, and the Python suite now covers a higher-value raw-export to inspect/import dry-run workflow without depending on live Grafana.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Include Dashboard Sources By Default In JSON List Output
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_list.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `list-dashboard --with-sources` existed mainly to keep text and table output from getting too wide and expensive, but JSON mode also required the extra flag even though machine-readable output benefits more from completeness than compactness.
- Current Update: Changed both Python and Rust dashboard list flows so `--json` automatically fetches dashboard payloads plus the datasource catalog and includes `sources` and `sourceUids` by default, while plain, table, and CSV output still require `--with-sources` to opt into the more expensive datasource expansion.
- Result: JSON list output is now self-contained for script consumers, while operator-facing table and CSV output remain compact unless users explicitly ask for datasource expansion.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Export Datasource Inventory With Raw Dashboard Exports
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Raw dashboard export already wrote `folders.json`, but it did not persist the live Grafana datasource catalog anywhere. `inspect-export` could summarize datasource references seen inside dashboard JSON, but it could not report the exported datasource inventory or compare unused datasources against dashboard usage offline.
- Current Update: Added `raw/datasources.json` plus `export-metadata.json::datasourcesFile`, wrote datasource inventory records during Python and Rust raw exports, and extended `inspect-export` human, table, and JSON outputs to include datasource inventory records with usage counts derived from dashboard references.
- Result: Raw exports now carry both folder and datasource inventories, and offline inspection can show which exported datasources are used, unused, or only partially referenced across the exported dashboards.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Align Prompt Export Labels With Grafana External Export
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboards/transformer.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_prompt.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard prompt export used Grafana-style `__inputs`, but the human-facing fields still drifted from Grafana external export behavior. Input `name` used stable internal placeholders such as `DS_PROMETHEUS_1`, while `label` and `pluginName` were generated from datasource type strings like `Prometheus datasource` and `prometheus` instead of preserving the original datasource name and a human-readable plugin title.
- Current Update: Changed both Python and Rust prompt-export rewrite paths to carry datasource display names through resolution, keep `DS_*` internal placeholder keys stable, emit `__inputs.label` from the original datasource name when known, and emit human-readable `pluginName` values such as `Prometheus` instead of raw type ids.
- Result: Prompt exports now stay closer to Grafana external export shape for human-facing datasource prompts while preserving the existing placeholder mapping strategy and prompt rewrite flow.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Python Access Client And Models
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, `grafana_utils/access/common.py`, `grafana_utils/access/models.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py` was still the largest Python module in the repo and mixed CLI parsing, Grafana access-management HTTP client behavior, row normalization, table/CSV/JSON rendering, and user/team/service-account workflows in one file.
- Current Update: Extracted the Grafana access API wrapper into `grafana_utils/clients/access_client.py`, moved row normalization and rendering helpers into `grafana_utils/access/models.py`, added `grafana_utils/access/common.py` for shared access constants and exceptions, and kept `grafana_utils/access_cli.py` as the stable facade by importing and re-exporting the moved pieces.
- Result: All three large Python CLIs now follow the same direction: the top-level `*_cli.py` modules are more orchestration-focused, while transport and domain-formatting logic live in smaller reusable modules.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Rust Alert Module Internals
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/alert_client.rs`, `rust/src/alert_list.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/alert.rs` had grown into a 2200+ line mixed module that combined clap definitions, auth-context building, the Grafana provisioning client, list rendering, export/import/diff orchestration, and shared alert document helpers in one file.
- Current Update: Split the Rust alert implementation into internal modules without changing the public alert CLI API or the existing test imports. `alert_cli_defs.rs` now owns clap parsing and auth normalization, `alert_client.rs` owns the Grafana alert provisioning client plus shared response parsers, and `alert_list.rs` owns list rendering and list-command dispatch. `alert.rs` now keeps the remaining alert document helpers plus export/import/diff orchestration.
- Result: The Rust alert implementation is materially easier to navigate and extend while preserving the existing `crate::alert` API, unified CLI behavior, and focused Rust tests.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Python Alert Client And Provisioning Helpers
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/alert_client.py`, `grafana_utils/alerts/common.py`, `grafana_utils/alerts/provisioning.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py` still mixed CLI parsing, Grafana alerting HTTP client behavior, linked-dashboard rewrite logic, alert provisioning import/export normalization, and list/export/import/diff orchestration in one 2100+ line Python module.
- Current Update: Extracted the alerting API wrapper into `grafana_utils/clients/alert_client.py`, moved provisioning import/export and linked-dashboard rewrite helpers into `grafana_utils/alerts/provisioning.py`, added `grafana_utils/alerts/common.py` for shared alert constants and exceptions, and kept `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py` as the stable CLI-facing facade by importing and re-exporting the moved helpers.
- Result: The Python alert implementation now follows the same split direction as the dashboard refactor and the existing Rust design: `alert_cli.py` is more focused on orchestration, while transport and provisioning logic live in dedicated Python modules that are easier to test and reuse.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Python Dashboard Client And Prompt Transformer
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/clients/dashboard_client.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/common.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboards/transformer.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` still mixed CLI parsing, Grafana HTTP transport behavior, prompt-export datasource rewrite helpers, and dashboard list/export/import orchestration in one 2400+ line Python module.
- Current Update: Extracted the dashboard HTTP wrapper into `grafana_utils/clients/dashboard_client.py`, moved prompt-export datasource rewrite and datasource-resolution helpers into `grafana_utils/dashboards/transformer.py`, added `grafana_utils/dashboards/common.py` for shared dashboard constants and exceptions, and kept `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py` as the stable facade by importing and re-exporting the moved pieces.
- Result: The Python dashboard implementation now follows the same split direction as the Rust dashboard modules: the CLI module stays focused on orchestration, while the client and prompt-transform code live in dedicated Python modules that are easier to test and reuse.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Rust Access Module Internals
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access.rs`, `rust/src/access_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/access_render.rs`, `rust/src/access_user.rs`, `rust/src/access_team.rs`, `rust/src/access_service_account.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/access.rs` had grown into an 1800-line mixed module that combined clap definitions, auth/client setup, output rendering, request helpers, user flows, team flows, service-account flows, and top-level dispatch.
- Current Update: Split the Rust access implementation into internal modules without changing the public access CLI API or test entrypoints. `access_cli_defs.rs` now owns clap/auth/client setup, `access_render.rs` owns formatting and normalization helpers, `access_user.rs` owns user flows, `access_team.rs` owns team flows, and `access_service_account.rs` owns service-account flows. `access.rs` now keeps shared request wrappers, re-exports, and top-level dispatch.
- Result: The Rust access implementation is materially easier to navigate and evolve while preserving the existing `crate::access` API, CLI behavior, and focused test imports.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Type Rust Dashboard Export Metadata And Index Models
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust dashboard export flow already validated fixed-schema files like `export-metadata.json` and `index.json`, but it still built and re-read those documents through ad hoc `Map<String, Value>` objects.
- Current Update: Replaced the fixed-schema dashboard export metadata and index helpers with typed Rust structs using `serde` derives, kept JSON field names stable through `serde` renames, and added focused serialization tests for the root index and export metadata shapes.
- Result: The dashboard export manifest path now gets stronger compile-time structure without changing the on-disk JSON format or the existing import/export CLI behavior.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Move Python Source-Tree Wrapper To python/ And Remove Python Access Shim
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana-utils.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `scripts/test-python-access-live-grafana.sh`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python source-tree usage still lived under `cmd/`, and the repo still shipped a Python `grafana-access-utils` wrapper plus console-script entry even after `grafana-utils access ...` became the primary Python access path.
- Current Update: Moved the source-tree Python wrapper to `python/grafana-utils.py`, removed the Python `grafana-access-utils` wrapper and console-script entry, updated the live access smoke script to invoke `python/grafana-utils.py access ...`, and refreshed current docs/tests to use the single Python command shape.
- Result: Python checkout usage now matches the unified CLI direction more cleanly: one source-tree wrapper under `python/` and one Python command surface built around `grafana-utils ...`.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Prompt Rewrite Module
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_prompt.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: After the first dashboard module split, `rust/src/dashboard.rs` still carried the largest remaining pure-transformation block: datasource resolution, prompt-export templating rewrites, and `build_external_export_document`.
- Current Update: Moved the dashboard prompt-export datasource resolution and template-rewrite pipeline into `rust/src/dashboard_prompt.rs`, then kept the existing `crate::dashboard` API stable through re-exports needed by sibling modules and tests.
- Result: The remaining `dashboard.rs` now reads more like orchestration plus shared IO/import/diff logic, while the prompt-export transformation logic lives in its own focused internal module.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Rust Dashboard Module Internals
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_list.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `rust/src/dashboard.rs` had grown into a 2700+ line module that mixed clap definitions, auth/client setup, dashboard and datasource list rendering, multi-org list/export orchestration, prompt-export rewrite logic, import flow, diff flow, and shared file helpers in one file.
- Current Update: Split the Rust dashboard implementation into internal modules without changing the public dashboard API or CLI behavior. `dashboard_cli_defs.rs` now owns clap/auth/client setup, `dashboard_list.rs` owns dashboard and datasource listing plus renderers, and `dashboard_export.rs` owns export pathing plus multi-org export orchestration. `dashboard.rs` now re-exports the same public entrypoints and keeps the remaining shared helpers, prompt rewrite, import, and diff flows.
- Result: The Rust dashboard implementation is materially smaller and easier to navigate while preserving the existing CLI surface and test entrypoints.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Remove grafana-alert-utils Compatibility Shim
- State: Done
- Scope: `pyproject.toml`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64-zig.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo had already consolidated alert workflows under `grafana-utils alert ...`, but still shipped a separate `grafana-alert-utils` Python wrapper, console script, Rust binary, and build artifacts as a compatibility shim.
- Current Update: Removed the Python wrapper, Python console-script entry, Rust standalone alert binary, and build-script artifact copies for `grafana-alert-utils`. Current docs, help text, smoke scripts, and tests now use `grafana-utils alert ...` as the only alert entrypoint.
- Result: The repo now exposes one primary alert command surface instead of keeping a second standalone alert executable alive after the unified CLI migration.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Alert List Commands And Direct Alert Aliases
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Alert workflows already had explicit `export`, `import`, and `diff`, but there was still no read-only alert listing surface and no direct-form aliases such as `export-alert` or `list-alert-rules`.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-utils alert list-rules`, `list-contact-points`, `list-mute-timings`, and `list-templates` in Python and Rust, with default table output plus `--csv`, `--json`, and `--no-header`. Also added top-level direct aliases `export-alert`, `import-alert`, `diff-alert`, and `list-alert-*`.
- Result: Alert workflows now match the dashboard command family more closely: there is an explicit read-only surface for common alert resource types, and operators can use either the canonical namespace form or the shorter direct alert aliases.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Split Alert CLI Into Export Import Diff Subcommands
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Alerting workflows still used one flat CLI surface driven by `--output-dir`, `--import-dir`, or `--diff-dir`. That made `grafana-utils alert` inconsistent with the dashboard namespace and hid the available alert modes from command help.
- Current Update: Added explicit `export`, `import`, and `diff` alert subcommands in both Python and Rust. The unified command now supports `grafana-utils alert export|import|diff ...`, while the standalone compatibility shim also supports `grafana-alert-utils export|import|diff ...`. Legacy flag-only invocation still works for compatibility.
- Result: The alert CLI now advertises its three modes directly in help output and matches the namespace style already used by `grafana-utils dashboard ...` and `grafana-utils access ...`.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Make Dashboard List Default To Tables And Add Progress Flags
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard list commands still defaulted to compact single-line text output, table headers could not be suppressed, and dashboard export/import printed per-dashboard progress lines by default instead of only when explicitly requested.
- Current Update: Changed Python and Rust `list-dashboard` plus `list-data-sources` to default to table output, added `--no-header` for those table-oriented list commands, and added `--progress` to `export-dashboard` and `import-dashboard` so per-dashboard progress lines are opt-in.
- Result: Operators now get a more readable default listing format, can remove table headers for scripts or copy/paste workflows, and can choose whether dashboard export/import should stay quiet or show item-by-item progress.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Concise And Verbose Dashboard Progress Modes
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard export and import only had a single `--progress` mode, which printed detailed per-item lines and did not provide a lighter-weight progress view for long runs.
- Current Update: Added a concise `--progress` mode for both Python and Rust dashboard export/import that prints one `current/total` line per dashboard, plus a new `-v/--verbose` mode that keeps detailed path/status output and supersedes the concise progress form.
- Result: Operators can now choose between quiet summary-only runs, compact progress for long jobs, or detailed item-by-item logging for troubleshooting.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Dry-Run Import Table Output
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import dry-run output was line-oriented only, so operators could not switch to a compact summary table when reviewing a larger batch.
- Current Update: Added `import-dashboard --dry-run --table` plus `--no-header` support in both Python and Rust, while rejecting `--table` outside dry-run mode.
- Result: Operators can keep the default line-oriented dry-run output or opt into a summary table that is easier to scan or pipe into snapshots.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Update-Existing-Only Dashboard Import Mode
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Dashboard import either created missing dashboards or failed on existing ones unless `--replace-existing` was set, but there was no mode for large local batches that should update only existing dashboard UIDs and ignore everything else.
- Current Update: Added `--update-existing-only` in Python and Rust dashboard import flows so matching UIDs update, missing UIDs are skipped, dry-run predicts `skip-missing`, and the summary/output modes report skipped counts clearly.
- Result: Operators can now point a large local raw export set at Grafana and safely reconcile only the dashboards that already exist there without accidentally creating the rest.

## 2026-03-13 - Task: Add Folder Inventory Export And Ensure-Folders Import
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/clients/dashboard_client.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_export.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Raw dashboard export preserved each dashboard's `folderUid`, but there was no exported folder inventory for rebuilding missing destination folders, so cross-environment imports still required manual folder setup.
- Current Update: Raw dashboard export now writes `raw/folders.json` and records `foldersFile` in the raw export manifest. Dashboard import gained `--ensure-folders`, which uses that inventory to create missing parent/child folders before importing dashboards, and `--dry-run --ensure-folders` now reports folder missing/match/mismatch state so operators can spot folder drift before a real run.
- Result: Operators can export one environment, move the raw payloads, let the importer recreate the referenced folder chain automatically, and validate folder path parity in dry-run mode instead of pre-creating every folder UID by hand.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Consolidate Python And Rust CLIs Under grafana-utils
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/unified_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `cmd/grafana-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-alert-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-access-utils.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `python/tests/test_python_unified_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-utils.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo had three split command names across Python and Rust. Dashboard already lived under `grafana-utils`, but alerting and access used separate primary binaries and docs still described the access path as split or Python-first.
- Current Update: Added a unified Python dispatcher and a unified Rust dispatcher so `grafana-utils` is now the primary command for `dashboard`, `alert`, and `access` workflows. Old dashboard direct forms such as `grafana-utils export-dashboard ...` still work as compatibility paths, and `grafana-alert-utils` plus `grafana-access-utils` remain available as shims.
- Result: Operators can now use one primary command shape in both implementations, while older scripts and muscle memory keep working through compatibility entrypoints during the transition.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Developer Grafana Sample-Data Seed Script
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/seed-grafana-sample-data.sh`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Developer live testing was relying on one-off manual API calls to create sample datasources, folders, dashboards, and extra orgs. That made repeated verification of `list-dashboard`, `export-dashboard`, and `list-data-sources` less reproducible.
- Current Update: Added `make seed-grafana-sample-data`, `make destroy-grafana-sample-data`, `make reset-grafana-all-data`, and a dedicated shell script that seeds, removes, or aggressively resets a running Grafana test dataset with stable sample orgs, datasources, folders, and dashboards using fixed ids and overwrite-friendly upserts.
- Result: Developers now have repo-owned setup, cleanup, and disposable-instance reset commands for rebuilding the same manual test dataset instead of repeating ad hoc setup steps during local Grafana testing.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Prompted Basic-Auth Password Support
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/common_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The CLIs only supported token auth, explicit `--basic-password`, or environment fallback password input. Operators who wanted Basic auth had to expose the password through shell history, process arguments, or environment variables.
- Current Update: Added `--prompt-password` everywhere Basic auth is supported, wired it into the shared Python and Rust auth resolvers, and added validation that rejects mixing prompt mode with token auth or explicit `--basic-password`.
- Result: Operators can now run Basic-auth commands with `--basic-user ... --prompt-password` and enter the password securely without echo while keeping the existing token and environment-based auth paths.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Platform-Specific Rust Build Paths
- State: Done
- Scope: `Makefile`, `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64.sh`, `scripts/build-rust-linux-amd64-zig.sh`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo could build native Rust release binaries on the current host only, but there was no explicit platform-targeted release workflow. In particular, macOS Apple Silicon and Linux `amd64` outputs did not have named Make targets or stable artifact directories.
- Current Update: Added `make build-rust-macos-arm64` for native Apple Silicon builds into `dist/macos-arm64/`, `make build-rust-linux-amd64` for Docker-based Linux `amd64` builds into `dist/linux-amd64/`, and `make build-rust-linux-amd64-zig` for non-Docker Linux `amd64` builds using local `zig`.
- Result: Operators on macOS now have explicit repo-owned release paths for native Apple Silicon binaries plus Linux `amd64` binaries through either Docker or local zig.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Update Dashboard Help Examples And Local Default URL
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard CLI still defaulted to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, and the real `-h` output either lacked examples entirely or only showed token-based remote examples. That made first-run local usage harder, especially for operators using Basic auth.
- Current Update: Changed the dashboard CLI default URL to `http://localhost:3000`, updated Python and Rust help output to show local Basic-auth examples plus token examples, and refreshed the public and maintainer docs to match the new local-first help text.
- Result: The shipped Python and Rust dashboard CLIs now guide operators toward a working local Grafana flow directly from `-h`, while still documenting token auth when needed.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Dashboard Multi-Org Export
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `export-dashboard` only operated in the current Grafana org context. Operators could not export one explicit org or aggregate exports across all visible orgs, even after `list-dashboard` gained org selection support.
- Current Update: Added `--org-id` and `--all-orgs` to Python and Rust `export-dashboard`. Both paths are Basic-auth-only. Explicit-org export reuses the existing layout, while multi-org export writes `org_<id>_<name>/raw/...` and `org_<id>_<name>/prompt/...` trees plus aggregate root-level variant indexes so cross-org dashboards do not overwrite each other.
- Result: Operators can now export dashboards from one chosen org or every visible org without manually switching Grafana org context first.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Dashboard Multi-Org Listing
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `list-dashboard` already exposed current-org metadata in each row, but it still only listed dashboards in the current request org context. Operators could not point the command at another org or aggregate dashboards across all visible orgs from one run.
- Current Update: Added `--org-id` and `--all-orgs` to Python and Rust `list-dashboard`. The command now accepts one explicit org override or enumerates `/api/orgs` and aggregates dashboard results across all visible orgs. Both paths are Basic-auth-only and preserve the existing `org` and `orgId` output fields for every listed dashboard.
- Result: Operators can now inspect one chosen Grafana org or all visible orgs from a single `list-dashboard` run instead of being limited to the auth context's current org.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Dashboard Datasource Listing Command
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard CLI could list dashboards and could fetch the datasource catalog internally, but there was no dedicated operator command to inspect Grafana data sources directly with table, CSV, or JSON output.
- Current Update: Added `list-data-sources` in both Python and Rust, reusing the existing datasource list API path and adding compact text, `--table`, `--csv`, and `--json` renderers for `uid`, `name`, `type`, `url`, and `isDefault`.
- Result: Operators can now inspect live Grafana data sources directly from `grafana-utils` without exporting dashboards or reading raw API responses.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Rename Dashboard CLI Subcommands
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard CLI exposed short subcommand names `export`, `list`, and `import`, while the repo now also contains separate alerting and access CLIs. The shorter names made the dashboard actions look inconsistent next to the more explicit access subcommands and left room for ambiguity when reading docs quickly.
- Current Update: Renamed the dashboard CLI subcommands to `export-dashboard`, `list-dashboard`, and `import-dashboard` in both Python and Rust, updated focused parser/help coverage, and refreshed public and maintainer docs to use the new names consistently.
- Result: Dashboard operations now read explicitly at the CLI boundary, and both Python and Rust `grafana-utils` help/output surfaces match the renamed operator workflow.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Dashboard List Org Metadata
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard `list` subcommand already showed folder and datasource context, but operators still could not see which Grafana organization the current authenticated view belonged to in text, table, CSV, or JSON output.
- Current Update: Added one current-org fetch through `GET /api/org` in both Python and Rust dashboard list paths, attached `org` and `orgId` to every listed dashboard summary, and extended the renderer/tests so compact text, table, CSV, and JSON output all include those fields alongside the existing folder and optional datasource metadata.
- Result: Operators can now tell which Grafana org produced a given dashboard list result without guessing from the base URL or credentials, and machine-readable list consumers now receive stable `org` and `orgId` fields in both Python and Rust.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Dashboard List Datasource Display
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard `list` subcommand already showed `uid`, `name`, `folder`, `folderUid`, and resolved folder path, but it could not show which datasource names each dashboard used.
- Current Update: Added an opt-in `--with-sources` flag to both Python and Rust dashboard list paths. When enabled, the command fetches the datasource catalog and each dashboard payload, resolves datasource references into display names, and appends those names to text, table, CSV, and JSON output. CSV output also carries a best-effort `sourceUids` column.
- Result: Operators can now inspect dashboard datasource usage directly from `grafana-utils list-dashboard --with-sources` without exporting dashboard files, while plain `list-dashboard` remains unchanged and cheaper. CSV consumers can also capture concrete datasource UIDs when Grafana exposed them.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Python Access Live Smoke Test
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-python-access-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI had live Docker validation recorded in docs, but there was no checked-in script to reproduce those user, team, and service-account workflows end to end.
- Current Update: Added a Docker-backed smoke script for the Python access CLI and a `make test-access-live` target. The script starts Grafana, bootstraps a token, then validates user add/modify/delete, team add/list/modify, and service-account add/token/list flows with the auth modes each command expects.
- Result: The repo now has a repeatable live validation path for the Python access CLI instead of relying only on ad hoc one-off Docker checks.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Expand Python Access Service-Account Live Smoke
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-python-access-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The checked-in Python access live smoke covered service-account add, token add, and list, but it did not validate the newer snapshot workflows or destructive cleanup flows against a real Grafana instance.
- Current Update: Extended the Docker-backed Python access smoke script to export service-account snapshots, validate delete and token-delete flows, replay the exported snapshot through dry-run and live import, rewrite the exported role to force a diff, confirm dry-run/live update import behavior, and finish with a no-drift diff check.
- Result: The checked-in live access smoke now exercises the service-account snapshot lifecycle end to end in addition to the earlier create/list flows.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Expand Rust Datasource Live Smoke
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust live smoke already validated datasource export/import and routed multi-org replay, but it did not exercise datasource add/delete against a real Grafana instance.
- Current Update: Extended the Rust Docker smoke script to create a second datasource through the Rust `datasource add` path, validate dry-run JSON output for add/delete, verify the created datasource through the Grafana API, and then remove it through the Rust `datasource delete` path before continuing with the existing export/import coverage.
- Result: The checked-in Rust live smoke now covers datasource add/delete in addition to the earlier datasource export/import and multi-org routing paths.

## 2026-03-15 - Task: Add Python Datasource Live Smoke
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-python-datasource-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Datasource real-Grafana validation had become Rust-heavy. The repo had no checked-in Python datasource live smoke path for add/delete/export/import or the new multi-org routed datasource replay flow.
- Current Update: Added a Docker-backed Python datasource smoke script and a `make test-python-datasource-live` target. The script bootstraps Grafana, validates datasource add/delete dry-run and live CRUD, validates single-org export/import dry-run, validates `export --all-orgs`, and validates `import --use-export-org --only-org-id --create-missing-orgs` dry-run/live replay.
- Result: The repo now has a repeatable Python datasource live validation path that complements the existing Rust datasource smoke coverage.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Access Utility Team Add
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`, `TODO.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI already covered `team list` and `team modify`, but `TODO.md` still listed `team add` as one of the remaining team-lifecycle gaps.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-access-utils team add` with parser/help wiring, Grafana team creation through the org-scoped team API, optional initial `--member` and `--admin` seeding, and aligned public and maintainer docs. The command creates the team first, then reuses the existing exact org-user resolution and safe membership/admin update flow.
- Result: At this point the Python access CLI now covered `team add` alongside the existing user, team-list, team-modify, and service-account workflows, leaving only `team delete` plus the `group` alias in the then-current team/group backlog.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Access Utility User List
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `cmd/grafana-access-utils.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo currently has dashboard and alerting CLIs only. `TODO.md` defines a future `grafana-access-utils` command shape, but there is no packaged script, wrapper, or public documentation for access-management workflows yet.
- Current Update: Added `grafana_utils/access_cli.py` with an initial Python access-management surface that now covers `user list` plus `service-account list`, `service-account add`, and `service-account token add`. Packaging wiring, focused unit coverage, and public/maintainer docs now describe the access CLI as Python-only for this first cut. The auth split is explicit: org-scoped user listing may use token or Basic auth, global user listing requires Basic auth, and the service-account commands are org-scoped and may use token or Basic auth.
- Result: The repo now ships a first Python access-management CLI surface for user listing and service-account creation flows, with focused tests plus a full Python suite pass confirming the new command does not regress the existing dashboard and alerting tools.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Access Utility Team List
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI already supports `user list` plus initial service-account commands, but `TODO.md` still lists all `team` operations as not started and the public docs say no `team` command exists yet.
- Current Update: Added a read-only `grafana-access-utils team list` command with org-scoped team search, optional member lookup, standard `--table|--csv|--json` output modes, and incomplete-command help for `grafana-access-utils team`. Public and maintainer docs now include the command and its auth expectations.
- Result: The Python access CLI now covers `user list`, `team list`, and the initial service-account workflows, with targeted and full Python test suite passes confirming the new command surface.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Access Utility User Add
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI already supports `user list`, `team list`, and the initial service-account commands, but it still cannot create Grafana users even though `TODO.md` calls out `user add` as one of the next lifecycle steps.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-access-utils user add` as a Basic-auth server-admin workflow that creates Grafana users through the admin API, supports optional org-role and Grafana-admin follow-up updates, and avoids the `--basic-password` versus new-user `--password` flag collision by separating the internal parser destinations and help text.
- Result: The Python access CLI now covers `user list`, `user add`, `team list`, and the initial service-account workflows, with targeted tests, the full Python suite, and a Docker-backed Grafana `12.4.1` smoke test confirming the new command path.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Access Utility Team Modify
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI can now list teams, but it still cannot add or remove team members or admins even though `TODO.md` puts `team modify` next in the planned access-management sequence.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-access-utils team modify` with `--team-id` or exact `--name` targeting, add/remove member actions, add/remove admin actions, and text or `--json` output. The command resolves users by exact login or email, uses org-scoped team APIs, and preserves admin changes safely by reading current member permission metadata before issuing the bulk admin update payload.
- Result: The Python access CLI now covers `user list`, `user add`, `team list`, `team modify`, and the initial service-account workflows, with targeted tests, the full Python suite, and Docker-backed Grafana `12.4.1` smoke tests confirming member and admin modification flows with both Basic auth and token auth.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Access Utility User Modify
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI can now create users and modify teams, but it still cannot update an existing user's identity fields, password, org role, or Grafana-admin state even though `TODO.md` lists `user modify` as the next user-lifecycle step.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-access-utils user modify` with id, login, or email targeting; explicit setters for login, email, name, password, org role, and Grafana-admin state; and text or `--json` output. The command is Basic-auth-only, updates profile fields and password through the global/admin user APIs, and reuses the existing org-role and permission update paths for role changes.
- Result: The Python access CLI now covers `user list`, `user add`, `user modify`, `team list`, `team modify`, and the initial service-account workflows, with targeted tests, the full Python suite, and a Docker-backed Grafana `12.4.1` smoke test confirming the update path.

## 2026-03-12 - Task: Add Access Utility User Delete
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access CLI can now create and modify users, but it still cannot remove users even though `TODO.md` keeps `user delete` as the next unfinished user-lifecycle step.
- Current Update: Added `grafana-access-utils user delete` with id, login, or email targeting; `--scope org|global`; required `--yes` confirmation; and text or `--json` output. Global deletion uses the admin delete API and requires Basic auth, while org-scoped removal uses the org user API and works with token or Basic auth.
- Result: At this point the Python access CLI now covered `user list`, `user add`, `user modify`, `user delete`, `team list`, `team modify`, and the initial service-account workflows, with targeted tests, the full Python suite, and Docker-backed Grafana `12.4.1` smoke tests confirming both global delete and org-scoped removal flows.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Remove Python Dependency From Rust Live Smoke Test
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust Docker smoke script required `python3` only to extract simple JSON fields while creating a Grafana API token.
- Current Update: Replaced the JSON field helper with `jq`, removed the explicit `python3` prerequisite from the script, replaced the last Perl-based in-place JSON rewrite with a `jq` temp-file rewrite, and now check for `jq` at startup.
- Result: The Rust live smoke test no longer depends on Python or Perl and now keeps its runtime requirements to Docker, curl, and `jq`.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Clarify Rust CLI Help Text
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust `-h` and `--help` output listed many flags without operator-facing explanations, so switches like `--flat` were hard to understand from the CLI alone.
- Current Update: Added explicit clap help text for common auth/TLS flags plus dashboard and alerting mode flags, and added help-output tests that assert the Rust help explains flat export layout and includes examples.
- Result: `grafana-utils export-dashboard -h` and `grafana-alert-utils -h` now explain what options do instead of only showing their names, reducing the need to cross-reference README or Python help for common workflows.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Preferred Auth Flag Aliases
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python dashboard and alerting CLIs only advertise `--api-token`, `--username`, and `--password`, even though the auth TODO now prefers `--token`, `--basic-user`, and `--basic-password`. Mixed token and Basic-auth input also resolves implicitly instead of failing early.
- Current Update: Added preferred CLI aliases for token and Basic auth in both Python CLIs while keeping the legacy flag names accepted, updated help text to advertise the preferred flags, and tightened `resolve_auth` so mixed token plus Basic input and partial Basic-auth input fail with clear operator-facing errors.
- Result: Operators can now use `--token`, `--basic-user`, and `--basic-password` consistently across both Python CLIs, while older flag names still parse. `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, and `python3 -m unittest -v` all pass after the auth validation change.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Dashboard List Subcommand
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard CLIs currently expose `export`, `import`, and `diff`, but there is no standalone operator command for listing dashboards without writing export files. The underlying `/api/search` lookup already exists only as an internal export helper.
- Current Update: Added a new explicit `list` subcommand in both Python and Rust dashboard CLIs, reusing the existing `/api/search` pagination path and enriching summaries with folder tree path from `GET /api/folders/{uid}` when `folderUid` is present. The command now supports compact text output, `--table`, `--csv`, and `--json`, with tests covering parser support, machine-readable renderers, table formatting, and folder hierarchy resolution.
- Result: Operators can now run `grafana-utils list` to inspect live dashboard summaries without exporting files first, and choose human-readable or machine-readable output with `--table`, `--csv`, or `--json`. The output fields are `uid`, `name`, `folder`, `folderUid`, and resolved folder tree path. Both `PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest -v python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py` and `cd rust && cargo test dashboard` pass, and the full Python and Rust test suites still pass after the new list formatting work.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Docker-Backed Rust Grafana Smoke Test
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust CLIs already have unit coverage, but the repo has no repeatable live Grafana validation path for the Rust export/import/diff/dry-run workflows. Manual Docker validation knowledge is scattered, and the Rust alerting client still rejects Grafana template-list responses when the API returns JSON `null`.
- Current Update: Added `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh` plus `make test-rust-live` to start a temporary Grafana Docker container, seed a datasource/dashboard/contact point, and exercise Rust dashboard export/import/diff/dry-run plus Rust alerting export/import/diff/dry-run. The script now defaults to pinned image `grafana/grafana:12.4.1`, auto-selects a free localhost port when `GRAFANA_PORT` is unset, and cleans up the container automatically. Also fixed the Rust alerting template-list path so `GET /api/v1/provisioning/templates` returning JSON `null` is treated as an empty list, matching the Python behavior.
- Result: `make test-rust-live` now passes locally against a temporary Docker Grafana instance, and `cd rust && cargo test` still passes after the Rust alerting null-handling fix. Maintainer and public docs now point at the live smoke-test entrypoint and its overrides.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Versioned Export Schema, Dry-Run, and Diff Workflows
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python CLIs can export and import Grafana dashboards and alerting resources, but there is no versioned export schema marker for dashboards, no dry-run path to preview import behavior safely, and no built-in diff workflow to compare local exports against live Grafana state.
- Current Update: Added versioned export metadata for dashboard exports and extended alerting tool documents/root indexes with `schemaVersion`, while keeping older alerting `apiVersion`-only tool docs importable. Added non-mutating import `--dry-run` behavior for both CLIs, added dashboard `diff` as an explicit subcommand, and added alerting `--diff-dir` to compare exported files with live Grafana resources. Both diff paths now print unified diffs for changed documents.
- Result: Operators can validate export shape compatibility, preview create/update behavior safely, and compare local exports against Grafana before applying changes. The focused Python dashboard and alerting suites plus the full Python suite pass with the new workflows.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Distinguish Python and Rust Test File Names
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_alert_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/http.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/common_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/http_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/alert_rust_tests.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python tests are named generically under `tests/test_*.py`, while Rust unit tests are inline inside implementation files. That makes it hard to distinguish Python and Rust test files by filename alone.
- Current Update: Renamed the Python test files to `test_python_*`, moved the Rust unit tests into dedicated `*_rust_tests.rs` files loaded from their parent modules, and updated maintainer docs to use the new test names and layout.
- Result: Python and Rust test files are now distinguishable by filename, and both `python3 -m unittest -v` and `cd rust && cargo test` still pass with the new layout.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Unified Build Makefile
- State: Done
- Scope: `Makefile`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo supports Python packaging and a separate Rust crate, but build commands are split across `pip` and `cargo` examples in the docs. There is no single root command surface for building the Python wheel and Rust release binaries together.
- Current Update: Added a root `Makefile` with Python, Rust, aggregate build, and aggregate test targets. Updated the English and Traditional Chinese README files plus maintainer docs to document those commands, and extended `.gitignore` for Python build outputs created by `make build-python`.
- Result: `make help`, `make build-python`, and `make build-rust` all pass locally. The Python target writes the wheel to `dist/`, and the Rust target produces release binaries under `rust/target/release/`.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Rename Dashboard Export Variant Flags
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both the packaged Python dashboard CLI and the Rust dashboard CLI expose short export-suppression flags, `--without-raw` and `--without-prompt`, with matching internal field names. The current docs and tests also use those shorter names.
- Current Update: Renamed the public export flags to `--without-dashboard-raw` and `--without-dashboard-prompt` in both implementations, renamed the corresponding Python namespace attributes and Rust struct fields, updated the rejection error text for disabling both variants, and refreshed the dashboard tests plus English and Traditional Chinese README examples.
- Result: The Python and Rust dashboard CLIs now use the longer dashboard-specific variant flag names consistently, and the focused dashboard unittest suite plus the full Rust and Python test suites pass with the new flag names.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Port Grafana HTTP and API Flows Into Rust
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/Cargo.lock`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/http.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-utils.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-alert-utils.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust crate can parse CLI arguments and normalize dashboard and alerting documents, but the actual Grafana HTTP client and live export/import flows are still stubbed with explicit not-implemented errors.
- Current Update: Added a shared Rust JSON HTTP client on top of `reqwest`, wired real dashboard raw export/import flows into `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, and wired real alerting export/import flows into `rust/src/alert.rs` for rules, contact points, mute timings, policies, and templates. The Rust alerting path now also includes linked-dashboard metadata export plus import-time dashboard UID repair logic. The remaining dashboard gap, prompt-export datasource rewrite, is now ported as well, including datasource-template-variable input generation and dependent-variable placeholder rewrites.
- Result: The Rust crate now executes the real Grafana HTTP/API flows and can produce both raw and prompt-style dashboard exports instead of relying on Python for datasource rewrite parity. `/opt/homebrew/bin/cargo test` passes, the targeted dashboard Rust tests pass, and the existing Python `python3 -m unittest -v` suite still passes.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Add Rust Rewrite Scaffold for Grafana Utilities
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/Cargo.lock`, `rust/src/lib.rs`, `rust/src/common.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/alert.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-utils.rs`, `rust/src/bin/grafana-alert-utils.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo ships only Python implementations. There is no Rust crate, no Rust CLI entrypoints, and no shared Rust model for dashboard or alerting document normalization.
- Current Update: Added an isolated `rust/` crate with shared auth and path helpers, a first-pass dashboard module, a first-pass alerting module, and Rust binary entrypoints for `grafana-utils` and `grafana-alert-utils`. The Rust port currently covers CLI parsing, auth/header resolution, path-building helpers, file discovery, and dashboard/alerting document normalization helpers, while the live HTTP flows still return explicit not-implemented errors.
- Result: The repository now contains a concrete Rust rewrite scaffold that can be extended incrementally without disturbing the shipping Python package. Existing Python tests still pass, and the new Rust crate now passes `cargo test` after the Rust toolchain was installed locally.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Package Grafana Utilities for Installation
- State: Done
- Scope: `pyproject.toml`, `grafana_utils/__init__.py`, `grafana_utils/dashboard_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/alert_cli.py`, `grafana_utils/http_transport.py`, `cmd/grafana-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `tests/test_packaging.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo runs from source, but it is not structured as an installable Python package. The implementation lives under `cmd/`, there is no packaging metadata, and there are no console entry points for global or per-user installs on other systems.
- Current Update: Moved the implementation into the `grafana_utils/` package, kept `cmd/` as thin source-tree wrappers, added `pyproject.toml` with console scripts for `grafana-utils` and `grafana-alert-utils`, and updated the English and Traditional Chinese docs plus maintainer guidance to cover normal, `--user`, and optional HTTP/2 installs. Packaging validation now includes package metadata tests and an isolated local `pip install --target` run.
- Result: The repo now supports installation as a Python package for either system/global environments or user-local environments while preserving direct repo execution through `cmd/`. Targeted tests and the full unittest suite passed. Local package installation also succeeded into `/tmp` with `--no-build-isolation`; a post-install `pyenv` rehash hook reported a local permissions warning after the install completed.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Enable Persistent Grafana HTTP Connections
- State: Done
- Scope: `cmd/grafana_http_transport.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The shared transport abstraction exists, but both transport adapters still issue one-shot requests. That means no deliberate connection reuse, and HTTP/2 is not attempted even when the runtime could support it.
- Current Update: Changed the `requests` transport to use a persistent `requests.Session`, changed the `httpx` transport to use a persistent `httpx.Client`, and added automatic HTTP/2 enablement for `httpx` only when the runtime has `h2` support available. The default transport selector now uses `auto`, which prefers HTTP/2-capable `httpx` when possible and otherwise falls back to `requests` keep-alive sessions.
- Result: Grafana HTTP requests now reuse connections by default, and HTTP/2 is enabled automatically only in environments that can actually negotiate it. Full unit tests still pass after the transport behavior change.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Make Grafana HTTP Transport Replaceable
- State: Done
- Scope: `cmd/grafana_http_transport.py`, `cmd/grafana-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both CLI tools embed `urllib` request handling directly inside their Grafana client classes. That makes the HTTP implementation fixed, mixes transport concerns into the resource clients, and leaves no clean seam for swapping `requests`, `httpx`, or a test transport.
- Current Update: Added a shared replaceable JSON transport module with `RequestsJsonHttpTransport` and `HttpxJsonHttpTransport`, changed both CLI clients to depend on an injected transport object, and kept `requests` as the default transport selected by the client constructors. Updated tests to load the shared transport module, verify both transport adapters build successfully, and exercise the new injected-transport seam directly.
- Result: The Grafana dashboard and alerting clients now use a replaceable transport architecture instead of hard-wired `urllib` calls. Full unit tests pass, and both CLIs can now switch HTTP engines by swapping the transport implementation rather than rewriting client logic.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Refactor Grafana CLI Readability
- State: Done
- Scope: `cmd/grafana-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-alert-utils.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both CLI modules are functionally covered by tests, but several import/export and API-normalization flows are long enough that humans need to read multiple branches at once to understand them. The current structure leans on comments and helper names, but key paths such as datasource rewriting and alert import dispatch still need cleaner decomposition.
- Current Update: Refactored the dashboard CLI by splitting datasource resolution, templating rewrite, and export index generation into smaller helpers. Refactored the alerting CLI by splitting linked-dashboard repair, export document generation, and per-resource import handling into clearer dispatcher-style helpers with smaller units of work.
- Result: Both CLIs now read more like orchestration code with named helper steps instead of large inline branches. Full unit tests still pass, so the refactor changed structure and readability without changing behavior.

## 2026-03-11 - Task: Move Grafana CLIs Into cmd
- State: Done
- Scope: `cmd/grafana-utils.py`, `cmd/grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `tests/__init__.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both CLI entrypoints currently live at the repository root as `grafana-utils.py` and `grafana-alert-utils.py`. Unit tests import those scripts by direct filesystem path, and the public and maintainer docs still show root-level invocation examples.
- Current Update: Moved both CLI entrypoints into `cmd/`, updated the path-sensitive test loaders and CLI help strings, refreshed the English and Traditional Chinese docs plus maintainer guidance to use `python3 cmd/...`, and added `tests/__init__.py` so the documented `python3 -m unittest -v` command discovers the suite.
- Result: The repository now keeps both CLIs under `cmd/` without changing their behavior, unit tests load the new file locations correctly, and both targeted test runs plus the full unittest command pass from the repo root.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Extend Grafana Alerting Resource Coverage
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana-alert-utils.py` already exports and imports alert rules, contact points, mute timings, and notification policies, and it can repair linked alert-rule dashboard UIDs by matching exported dashboard metadata. It does not yet cover notification templates, manual dashboard UID maps, or panel ID maps.
- Current Update: Added notification template export/import support, including version-aware template updates on `--replace-existing` and empty-list handling when Grafana returns `null`. Added `--dashboard-uid-map` and `--panel-id-map` so linked alert rules can be remapped explicitly during import before the existing metadata fallback logic runs. Exported linked-dashboard metadata now also captures panel title and panel type when available, and the README now documents the new alerting resource scope and mapping-file usage.
- Result: The standalone alert CLI now covers templates in addition to the existing alerting resources, supports operator-provided dashboard and panel remapping files for linked rules, and keeps the older dashboard-title/folder/slug fallback for cases where no explicit map is provided.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Rename Grafana Dashboard Export Flag
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The dashboard export subcommand uses `--output-dir`, which is generic enough to be confused with import behavior now that the CLI has explicit import and export modes.
- Current Update: Renamed the dashboard export flag to `--export-dir`, updated the parsed attribute and help text, and changed dashboard README examples and tests to use the more explicit export-only name.
- Result: The dashboard CLI now uses `--export-dir` for export mode, which better matches the subcommand and reduces mode confusion.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Add Grafana Dashboard Import and Export Subcommands
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `grafana-utils.py` decides between export and import implicitly by checking whether `--import-dir` is present, so export-only and import-only flags live in the same top-level parser and can be confused.
- Current Update: Split the dashboard CLI into explicit `export` and `import` subcommands, moved mode-specific flags onto the matching subparser, and added maintainer comments in the parser setup explaining why the split exists. README examples now call the subcommands directly.
- Result: Operators must now choose import or export explicitly at the command line, which removes the ambiguous mode inference and makes misuse harder.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Change Grafana Default Server URL
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-utils.py`, `grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both utilities default to `https://10.21.104.120`, which assumes a specific remote server instead of a local Grafana instance.
- Current Update: Changed both CLI defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, added unit tests that assert the new parse-time default, and updated README command examples to match.
- Result: Operators now get a local Grafana default out of the box and can still override it with `--url` when targeting another instance.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Make Grafana Utilities RHEL 8 Python Compatible
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-utils.py`, `grafana-alert-utils.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Both utility scripts use `from __future__ import annotations`, PEP 585 built-in generics like `list[str]`, and PEP 604 unions like `str | None`, which Python 3.6 on RHEL 8 cannot parse.
- Current Update: Replaced those annotations with `typing` module equivalents such as `List[...]`, `Dict[...]`, `Optional[...]`, and `Tuple[...]`, removed the unsupported future import so both scripts remain parseable on Python 3.6 without changing behavior, added parser-level tests that validate both entrypoints against Python 3.6 grammar, and documented RHEL 8+ support in the README.
- Result: The dashboard and alerting utilities now avoid Python 3.9+/3.10+ annotation syntax, explicitly document RHEL 8+ support, and have automated syntax checks that keep them compatible with RHEL 8's default Python parser.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Add Grafana Alerting Utility
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-alert-utils.py`, `tests/test_grafana_alert_utils.py`, `README.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Alert rules are not supported. The workspace only has dashboard export/import tooling in `grafana-utils.py`.
- Current Update: Expanded the standalone alerting CLI so it now exports and imports four resource types under `alerts/raw/`: rules, contact points, mute timings, and notification policies. Import uses create by default, switches to update with `--replace-existing` for rules/contact points/mute timings, and always applies the notification policy tree with `PUT`. The current increment adds alert-rule linkage metadata export for `__dashboardUid__`/`__panelId__`, plus import-time fallback that rewrites missing dashboard UIDs by matching the target Grafana dashboard on exported title/folder/slug metadata. Validation now includes a live Docker scenario where a linked rule was exported from dashboard UID `source-dashboard-uid`, the source dashboard was deleted, a replacement dashboard with UID `target-dashboard-uid` but the same title/folder/slug was created, and alert import rewrote the rule linkage to the new dashboard UID automatically.
- Result: Grafana alerting backup/restore is now separated from `grafana-utils.py` and covers the core alerting resources needed for notifications. The tool rejects Grafana provisioning `/export` files for API import, documents the limitation, has dedicated unit tests, and now preserves or repairs panel-linked alert rules when dashboard UIDs differ across Grafana systems.

## 2026-03-10 - Task: Export Grafana Dashboards
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana-utils.py`, `tests/test_dump_grafana_dashboards.py`
- Baseline: Workspace is empty and there is no existing Grafana export utility.
- Current Update: Added `--without-raw` and `--without-prompt` so operators can selectively suppress one export variant while keeping the dual-export default. The exporter now rejects disabling both at once.
- Result: The tool now supports both workflows: export both variants by default, or export only `raw/` or only `prompt/` when needed. API import still requires an explicit path and should point at `raw/`.
## 2026-03-15 - Task: Promote Python Access User/Team Diff to Supported Status
- State: Done
- Scope: `grafana_utils/access_cli.py`, `python/tests/test_python_access_cli.py`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/user-guide-TW.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Python access workflows already had `diff_users_with_client` and `diff_teams_with_client`, but the top-level Python facade did not re-export those helpers and the public docs still described Python access snapshots and drift comparison as Rust-only.
- Current Update: Re-exported Python access export/import/diff helpers from `grafana_utils.access_cli`, added dispatch coverage for `access user diff` and `access team diff`, and updated the English/Traditional Chinese README plus both user guides so access user/team export, import, and diff are documented as supported Python workflows.
- Result: Python and Rust now present the same supported access command surface for user/team snapshot export, import, and diff in the operator docs, and the Python facade/tests explicitly cover the diff entrypoints.
## 2026-03-16 - Task: Refine Rust Dashboard Screenshot Chrome Hiding
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust `dashboard screenshot` command could hide the Grafana sidebar, but remote full-page captures still kept the top toolbar/header in the output.
- Current Update: Extended the browser DOM preparation step to hide fixed/sticky top chrome in addition to the sidebar before stitched full-page capture. Live validation against the remote Grafana dashboard `eei8l48f3s3k0f` now produces a dark-mode full-page PNG without the top toolbar.
- Result: Browser-rendered full-page screenshots are cleaner and closer to report-style output, while dashboard variables can still be selected through repeatable `--var name=value` assignments.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Accept Full Grafana Dashboard URLs for Screenshot and Variable Inspection
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_vars.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust screenshot capture required separate `--url` plus `--dashboard-uid`, and the new variable inspection helper did not exist.
- Current Update: Added `dashboard inspect-vars`, allowed both `dashboard screenshot` and `dashboard inspect-vars` to accept a full Grafana dashboard URL, and taught screenshot URL-building to reuse URL state such as `var-*`, `from`, `to`, `orgId`, and `panelId` while still letting explicit CLI flags override those values.
- Result: Operators can now paste a browser dashboard URL directly into the Rust CLI and preserve its current variable/query-string state without manually re-entering every `--var`.

## 2026-03-16 - Task: Strengthen Rust Screenshot Query-State Debugging and Readiness
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/src/http.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_cli_defs.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_screenshot.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_vars.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `--vars-query` only overlaid `var-*` values, screenshot runs could not print the final resolved URL, API inspection on one remote Grafana hit response-body decode errors, and browser capture could stop at Grafana's loading spinner or SPA navigation wait.
- Current Update: Extended screenshot query-fragment parsing to preserve non-variable query keys such as `refresh`, `showCategory`, and `timezone`; added `--print-capture-url`; forced the Rust HTTP client onto a more compatible JSON-bytes/HTTP1.1 path; and tightened screenshot readiness to wait for panel content while avoiding the stuck navigation event path. Live validation against dashboard `rYdddlPWk` confirmed the final capture URL and preserved query state.
- Result: Screenshot/debug workflows now expose the exact resolved URL, keep more Grafana browser state intact, and are more reliable against remote Grafana instances that previously failed in API decode or browser-ready handling.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Re-sign macOS Rust Dist Binary After Copy
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `scripts/build-rust-macos-arm64.sh` copies `rust/target/release/grafana-util` into `dist/macos-arm64/` without refreshing the copied Mach-O signature. On macOS, the copied `dist/macos-arm64/grafana-util` can then be killed at launch, including on `--help`, even though the original `rust/target/release/grafana-util` still runs.
- Current Update: Added an explicit ad hoc `codesign --force --sign -` step after copying the native release binary into `dist/macos-arm64/`, and added a packaging test that asserts the macOS build script keeps that re-sign step.
- Result: Rebuilt `dist/macos-arm64/grafana-util` now runs normally on Apple Silicon, including `--help`, and the local macOS log evidence points to the old copied binary being rejected because the copied file `mtime` no longer matched the validated code-signing state.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Add Unified Root Help-Full Rendering
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/cli.rs`, `rust/src/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust unified CLI only recognizes root `-h/--help`. `--help-full` existed only for `dashboard inspect-export` and `dashboard inspect-live`, so `grafana-util --help-full` and top-level domain forms such as `grafana-util alert --help-full` fell through to clap and errored as unexpected arguments.
- Current Update: Added explicit unified interception for root `--help-full` plus top-level `alert`, `datasource`, `access`, and `sync` `--help-full`. Each path now reuses the normal help text and appends an `Extended Examples:` block with bracketed example labels, and TTY color mode now also highlights those extended labels with the same domain color scheme as the existing root examples.
- Result: Rebuilt macOS arm64 binaries now render `grafana-util --help-full`, `grafana-util alert --help-full`, `grafana-util datasource --help-full`, `grafana-util access --help-full`, and `grafana-util sync --help-full` successfully, while the existing dashboard inspect `--help-full` behavior remains unchanged.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Collapse Python Layout To One Parent Path
- State: Done
- Scope: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`, `python/__pycache__/grafana-utils.cpython-312.pyc`
- Baseline: The repo already shipped and imported Python code from `grafana_utils/`, but maintainer docs still described a parallel `python/` wrapper layer even though that path no longer contained a real source-tree entrypoint.
- Current Update: Removed the stale `python/` bytecode residue and updated maintainer guidance to treat `grafana_utils/` as the single parent path for Python code and source-tree entrypoints.
- Result: The Python repo layout is now consistent with the actual package structure, and there is no extra `python/` directory left to imply a second source location.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Move Python Package Under python/
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/`, `pyproject.toml`, `python/tests/test_python_packaging.py`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo had already converged on one Python package, but it still lived at the repo root as `grafana_utils/`. That kept the import namespace clean, but it left Python source outside the dedicated `python/` parent path the maintainer wanted.
- Current Update: Moved the package tree to `python/grafana_utils/` and updated Poetry, setuptools, packaging tests, and maintainer docs so the repo now uses `python/` as the single parent directory while preserving the `grafana_utils.*` module namespace.
- Result: The on-disk Python layout is now cleaner and more conventional for a repo with mixed-language roots, without changing the installed console script or Python import names.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Move Python Tests Under python/tests
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/tests/`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/overview-python.md`, `docs/unit-test-inventory.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python source had already moved under `python/grafana_utils/`, but the unit tests still lived at the repo root under `tests/`. That left Python code split across two top-level parents and kept many maintainer docs pointing at the old test paths.
- Current Update: Moved the Python test tree to `python/tests/`, updated test helper path resolution for the new source/test roots, and rewrote current maintainer-facing test path references and repo-local unittest commands to use `PYTHONPATH=python`.
- Result: The repo now has one clear Python parent directory, `python/`, containing both `grafana_utils/` and `tests/`, while import names and package metadata remain unchanged.

## 2026-03-17 - Task: Move Rust Dashboard Into dashboard/ Module Directory
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust dashboard domain had already been split across many focused files, but they still sat flat under `rust/src/` as `dashboard_*.rs`, which made the crate root increasingly crowded.
- Current Update: Moved the Rust dashboard facade, helpers, analyzers, screenshot support, and tests into `rust/src/dashboard/`, converted the facade to `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, and kept the public crate module name as `crate::dashboard`.
- Result: The largest Rust domain now has a dedicated directory boundary, which reduces root-level file sprawl without changing the external module path used by the rest of the crate.
## 2026-03-17 - Task: Move Rust Access Into access/ Module Directory
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The Rust access domain had already been split by responsibility, but access files still lived flat under `rust/src/` as `access*.rs`, which increased crate-root crowding.
- Current Update: Moved Rust access facade, helpers, and tests into `rust/src/access/`, switched the facade to `rust/src/access/mod.rs`, and rewired access internal references to local child module names (`cli_defs`, `org`, `user`, `team`, `service_account`, `pending_delete`, `render`).
- Result: `crate::access` stays stable for callers while access internals now have a dedicated directory boundary and cleaner module-local naming.
## 2026-03-19 - Task: Accept Multi-Org Dashboard Export Roots In inspect-export
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/inspect.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/mod.rs`, `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_runtime.py`, `python/grafana_utils/dashboards/inspection_workflow.py`, `python/tests/test_python_dashboard_inspection_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `dashboard inspect-export` only accepted one org-scoped `raw/` directory. Pointing it at a multi-org dashboard export root failed on the root manifest, and Rust report rows on merged multi-org data could surface empty `ORG` / `ORG_ID` cells when raw index paths were absolute.
- Current Update: Added multi-org export-root detection to both Python and Rust inspect workflows, materialized a temporary merged raw inspect directory from `org_*/raw` children, carried merged folder/datasource/index inventories forward, and normalized Rust raw-index paths so per-query report rows recover `org` / `orgId` from real export metadata.
- Result: Operators can now point `grafana-util dashboard inspect-export` at a combined `--all-orgs` dashboard export root directly, while Rust report/table output preserves populated org scope columns on the merged multi-org path.
## 2026-03-19 - Task: Add Rust Datasource Auth Flags Parity
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/datasource.rs`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust datasource live mutation commands already supported `--json-data` and `--secure-json-data`, but they did not expose the datasource-oriented auth and transport flags that Python had, such as `--basic-auth`, `--basic-auth-user`, `--basic-auth-password`, `--user`, `--password`, `--with-credentials`, `--http-header`, `--tls-skip-verify`, and `--server-name`.
- Current Update: Added those datasource auth/header/TLS flags to Rust `datasource add` and `datasource modify`, translated them into the correct top-level, `jsonData`, and `secureJsonData` payload fields, preserved the existing explicit-object collision guards, and extended the Rust tests to cover parser/help behavior plus payload shaping and the `--basic-auth-password requires --basic-auth-user` guard.
- Result: Rust can now exercise the same datasource auth configuration surface as Python for add/modify flows, including live Prometheus-style auth/header cases, while keeping request-payload validation and test coverage explicit.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Add Live Smoke Coverage For Datasource Secret Persistence
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-python-datasource-live-grafana.sh`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The datasource live smoke scripts covered add/delete/export/import flows, but they did not assert the Grafana-managed persisted-state behavior for secret-bearing datasource mutations. The Python datasource smoke script also still assumed repo-local `python -m grafana_utils` worked without setting `PYTHONPATH=python`.
- Current Update: Added focused live checks in both datasource smoke scripts that create a secret-bearing Prometheus datasource, verify `basicAuthUser`, `jsonData.httpHeaderName1`, and durable `secureJsonFields` markers after add, then verify that modify keeps the prior secret flags instead of treating `secureJsonData` as a direct persisted-state echo. The Python script now invokes the repo-local CLI with `PYTHONPATH` set explicitly.
- Result: The checked-in datasource live smoke paths now cover the real Grafana secret-persistence contract for add/modify, and the Python datasource smoke script matches the current repo layout instead of depending on an installed package.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Re-Align Python Datasource Export With Strict Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python datasource export was reusing the broader dashboard datasource inventory helper, so `datasources.json` could contain extra fields such as `database`, `defaultBucket`, `organization`, and `indexPattern`. The Python importer was intentionally strict and rejected those fields, which broke the checked-in full datasource live smoke on its own export/import round-trip.
- Current Update: Normalized datasource export records back down to the strict datasource contract at the export boundary, and added a regression test that seeds those extra dashboard-style fields but asserts the written `datasources.json` still contains only `uid`, `name`, `type`, `access`, `url`, `isDefault`, `org`, and `orgId`.
- Result: Python datasource export/import are aligned again on one stable contract, and the full Python datasource Docker smoke passes against Grafana 12.4.1 instead of failing on its own exported records.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Normalize Python Datasource Export Records
- State: In progress
- Scope: `python/grafana_utils/datasource/workflows.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python datasource export reused the dashboard inventory record builder, so exported `datasources.json` could carry dashboard-oriented fields such as `database`, `defaultBucket`, `organization`, and `indexPattern` even though datasource import/diff only accepts the strict contract fields.
- Current Update: Switched datasource export to normalize each record into the strict datasource contract before writing `datasources.json`, and extended the export regression test to seed live records with the dashboard-only fields so the exporter is forced to drop them.
- Result: The Python datasource export/import contract is now aligned again, and the live datasource smoke path should stop failing on unsupported dashboard-only fields during export replay.
## 2026-03-21 - Task: Tighten Dashboard Inspect JSON Output-File Parity
- State: In Progress
- Scope: `rust/src/dashboard/rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Current Update: Added a shared Rust parity test that writes and rereads inspect-export and inspect-live `report-json`, `governance-json`, and `dependency-json` output files from the same seeded core-family fixture, with newline-terminated file checks and stable row-field assertions.
- Result: Pending focused Rust validation.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Ignore Dashboard Permission Bundles In Sync Discovery
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/sync/mod.rs`, `rust/src/sync/cli_rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: `sync bundle` walked the dashboard export tree with its own JSON discovery and treated `permissions.json` like a dashboard document, which caused the live smoke to fail on `Dashboard export document is missing dashboard.uid: permissions.json`.
- Current Update: Added `permissions.json` to the sync dashboard discovery ignore list, added a focused regression that keeps `sync bundle` green when the file is present, and aligned the Rust live smoke script with the actual smoke fixture by checking the exported contact point count, the zero-alert-rule case, and the current cleanup semantics.
- Result: Rust sync bundle discovery now ignores dashboard permission bundles consistently with dashboard import, and the full Rust Docker live smoke passes again against Grafana 12.4.1.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Share Datasource Types Catalog Contract Across Python And Rust
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/datasource_supported_types_catalog.json`, `python/grafana_utils/datasource/catalog.py`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python and Rust each had their own datasource catalog assertions for `datasource types --json`, but they were duplicated and could drift independently. There was no single checked-in contract proving both runtimes emitted the same stable catalog surface for `suggestedFlags`, `presetProfiles`, `addDefaults`, and `fullAddDefaults`.
- Current Update: Added a shared catalog fixture and switched both Python and Rust datasource catalog tests to project the live catalog JSON down to the stable operator-facing keys before comparing it to that one fixture. The new shared contract immediately surfaced a real parity bug: Python was marking `sqlite` as requiring `--datasource-url`, so the Python catalog entry was corrected to `requiresDatasourceUrl=false` to match Rust and the intended file-backed datasource behavior.
- Result: The datasource supported-types catalog now has one cross-language contract, and Python/Rust stay aligned on the operator-facing introspection fields instead of relying on separate duplicated expectations.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Share Preset-Profile Payload Contracts Across Python And Rust
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/datasource_preset_profile_add_payload_cases.json`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `rust/src/datasource_rust_tests.rs`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Preset-profile payload behavior was covered by a mix of one-off Python and Rust assertions plus the older nested/secure fixtures, but there was no single shared fixture for add-path preset scaffolds. That left the most active parity surface, `starter` / `full` payload generation, open to Python/Rust drift.
- Current Update: Added a shared add-path preset-profile payload fixture covering `prometheus` starter, `loki` full, `tempo` full with nested override, and `postgresql` full, then wired both Python and Rust tests to consume it. Kept the existing nested `jsonData` and `secureJsonData` shared fixtures in place for modify-path deep-merge, array-replace, and secret replacement semantics.
- Result: Preset-profile payload parity is now split into one stable add-path fixture plus the existing modify/secure fixtures, so Python and Rust are checked against the same contract for the payload-builder behavior that has been changing the most.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Add A Combined Datasource Live Smoke Gate
- State: Done
- Scope: `scripts/test-combined-live-grafana.sh`, `Makefile`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: The repo already had separate Docker-backed live smokes for Rust and Python datasource flows, but there was no single entrypoint to run both back-to-back. Rechecking cross-runtime datasource behavior still required remembering and sequencing two separate commands.
- Current Update: Added a thin fail-fast wrapper script that runs the Rust live smoke first and the Python datasource live smoke second, then wired a new `make test-datasource-live` target to that wrapper and documented the combined gate in maintainer notes.
- Result: There is now one combined datasource live-smoke command that revalidates both runtimes against local Docker Grafana without manually chaining separate targets.
## 2026-03-20 - Task: Share Datasource Preset Payload Modify Fixtures In Python
- State: Done
- Scope: `fixtures/datasource_preset_profile_payload_cases.json`, `python/tests/test_python_datasource_cli.py`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Python preset-profile modify and secure JSON assertions were split across separate fixture files, which made the payload contract harder to extend and harder to keep aligned across Loki, Tempo, and secure JSON semantics.
- Current Update: Added one shared preset-profile payload fixture covering Loki array replacement, Tempo nested JSON merge, and secure JSON add/modify semantics, then switched the Python tests to consume that shared contract directly.
- Result: Python now exercises the preset-profile payload cases from one shared fixture, reducing drift and making it easier to add more payload cases without duplicating case data.
## 2026-03-21 - Task: Expand Rust Access Service-Account Replay Contract
- State: Done
- Scope: `rust/src/access/rust_tests.rs`, `scripts/test-rust-live-grafana.sh`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/internal/ai-status.md`, `docs/internal/ai-changes.md`
- Baseline: Rust service-account coverage stopped at add/export/token-delete/delete/list. The runtime already had import and diff handlers, but there was no focused contract for missing-account create replay, same-state diff, or the live export -> mutate -> dry-run import -> replay -> recreate path.
- Current Update: Added focused Rust service-account tests for the structured-output dry-run guard, missing-account create replay, and no-difference diff behavior. Extended the Rust Docker live smoke so the service-account section now verifies export same-state diff, mutated bundle drift, dry-run import update preview, live replay, same-state diff after replay, delete, and recreate import.
- Result: Focused Rust service-account contract tests and the full Rust Docker live smoke now pass, so the Rust access service-account line has export/diff/import/replay coverage instead of stopping at CRUD/token smoke.
