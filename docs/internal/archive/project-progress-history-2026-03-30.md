# Project Progress History And Workflow Inventory

Date: 2026-03-30
Scope: `git log` from repository start through `2026-03-30`, cross-checked against the current Rust-first command surface and maintainer docs.
Audience: personal project review, weekly progress reporting, and company-style visibility into what has actually been built.

## 1. Executive Summary

This repository started on `2026-03-10` as a narrower Grafana dashboard and alert export/import utility. By `2026-03-30`, it has become a Rust-mainline operator toolkit centered on the unified `grafana-util` CLI.

Observed from git history:

- total commits reviewed: `411`
- active build window in this history slice: `2026-03-10` to `2026-03-30`
- current maintained mainline: Rust `grafana-util`
- Python status: still present as maintainer/reference material, but no longer the primary operator surface

The overall trajectory is clear:

1. bootstrap dashboard and alert export/import
2. unify command structure and package the tool
3. expand into access, datasource, and sync workflows
4. deepen governance, inspection, topology, audit, and review-first safety
5. land project-wide overview and status surfaces

In practical terms, the project is no longer only a backup/import tool. It now covers:

- dashboard inventory, inspect, export/import, diff, delete, screenshot, and governance review
- datasource inventory, export/import, diff, and bounded live mutation
- alert inventory plus export/import/diff of alerting resources
- access lifecycle workflows for users, orgs, teams, and service accounts
- staged sync, review, apply, audit, bundle, and promotion-preflight flows
- cross-domain overview and project-status reporting

## 2. Weekly Summary

### 2026-W11 (`2026-03-10` to `2026-03-15`, `200` commits)

This was the foundation and product-definition week.

- The project started with dashboard export/import and alert utility flows.
- The unified command direction was established and later renamed to `grafana-util`.
- Rust became a serious implementation target, not just a side experiment.
- Access management, datasource handling, and sync planning all began in this week.
- Packaging, install flow, Makefile, docs structure, auth handling, dry-run/diff behavior, and release/version policy were also set up here.

Main outcome:

- the repo moved from "a couple of Grafana scripts" to "a growing operator toolkit with a clear command model"

### 2026-W12 (`2026-03-16` to `2026-03-22`, `119` commits)

This was the contract-hardening and usability week.

- CLI help was reorganized and aliases were added.
- sync artifacts, schemas, and typed outputs were made more formal
- screenshot, variable inspection, governance gate, and dependency inspection grew into real operator surfaces
- multi-org inventory expanded further for dashboards and alerts
- release automation and GitHub packaging were tightened
- Python/Rust parity and contract alignment were repeatedly corrected

Main outcome:

- the toolkit became easier to operate, easier to release, and more trustworthy for structured review workflows

### 2026-W13 (`2026-03-23` to `2026-03-28`, `91` commits)

This was the deep Rust workflow and TUI week.

- governance gate became much richer and more policy-oriented
- topology, dependency analysis, perf audit, Prometheus cost audit, and schema review were added
- sync audit and review diff workflows matured significantly
- interactive TUIs for dashboard and sync review were added
- browse/delete/import-review workflows became much stronger
- promotion-preflight and datasource-secret placeholder checks appeared
- large Rust modules were split aggressively to protect maintainability

Main outcome:

- the project crossed from "CLI with many subcommands" into "review-first operational workbench with analysis and TUI support"

### 2026-W14 (`2026-03-30`, `1` commit)

This was the project-level visibility landing.

- staged and live `overview` / `project-status` surfaces were landed

Main outcome:

- the repository gained a project-wide status layer above individual domains

## 3. Design Depth Visible From The History

What stands out in the commit history is not only command count. The more important signal is that the project kept deepening its operating model.

### Unified Product Design

- The project did not stay as separate dashboard, alert, and access utilities.
- It was intentionally pulled into one namespaced operator surface: `grafana-util`.
- That gives the project a real product identity instead of a loose collection of scripts.

### Rust-Mainline Transition

- The repo did not merely "add Rust support".
- It progressively shifted the maintained operator surface to Rust while keeping Python as reference and compatibility context.
- This shows a deliberate move toward stronger runtime packaging, typed contracts, and long-term maintainability.

### Review-First Workflow Design

- Many flows are designed around `export -> inspect/diff/preflight -> dry-run/review -> apply`.
- This is visible across dashboard, datasource, alert, and sync work.
- The project is clearly optimized for safer operational change, not only raw API convenience.

### Staged Versus Live Separation

- The repository repeatedly reinforced the distinction between staged artifacts and live Grafana state.
- That separation appears in sync, promotion, overview, and project-status work.
- This is a meaningful architecture decision because it keeps planning, review, and mutation traceable.

### Governance And Analysis As First-Class Features

- The project went beyond CRUD and backup flows.
- It added dependency inspection, governance policies, topology graphs, blast-radius reporting, schema review, and cost/performance audit signals.
- This significantly raises the value from "tooling helper" to "operator decision support system".

### Multi-Org And Replay Awareness

- Multi-org inventory, export, import, and org-routed replay were not treated as afterthoughts.
- The history shows repeated work on org scope, permission metadata, export-org guards, and replay behavior.
- That indicates real design attention to enterprise-like Grafana operating conditions.

### Interactive Operator Experience

- The project did not stop at text commands.
- It introduced browse, review, and TUI workbench flows for dashboard and sync operations.
- This reflects design effort around real operational review, not just file generation.

### Project-Level Visibility

- The landing of `overview` and `project-status` is important because it moves the repo above single-command silos.
- It creates a project-wide visibility layer that can summarize staged and live state across domains.
- That is a product-level maturation step, not a cosmetic feature.

## 5. Current Product Shape

Current maintained root commands:

- `grafana-util dashboard`
- `grafana-util datasource`
- `grafana-util alert`
- `grafana-util access`
- `grafana-util sync`
- `grafana-util overview`
- `grafana-util project-status`

Short aliases already exist for some top-level domains:

- `grafana-util db`
- `grafana-util ds`
- `grafana-util sy`

Strategic reading of the current state:

- `dashboard`, `datasource`, `alert`, `access`, and `sync` are the domain lanes
- `overview` and `project-status` are project-level visibility lanes
- Rust is the production-facing operator runtime
- Python remains useful for reference, compatibility, and maintainership context

## 6. Current Workflow Map

### Dashboard Workflow

Primary operator story:

1. inventory live dashboards
2. inspect dependencies, queries, governance, and topology

2. render one project-wide status view
3. distinguish staged readiness from live Grafana state
4. give a whole-project triage surface instead of only domain-level output

Representative commands:

- `grafana-util overview`
- `grafana-util overview live`
- `grafana-util project-status`
- `grafana-util project-status live`

## 7. Functional Coverage By Need

If the project is described by operator need instead of module name, the coverage is now:

- dashboard migration and inspection: strong
- datasource migration and live admin: strong
- alert asset export/import/diff: solid
- identity and org lifecycle management: solid
- review-first sync and promotion safety: strong and still one of the most strategic differentiators
- whole-project staged/live visibility: newly landed and strategically important

## 8. Progress Assessment

From the repository history and current maintainer notes, the project appears to be in this state:

- foundation stage: complete
- unified CLI stage: complete
- domain workflow expansion stage: complete enough for current pass
- governance / review / audit stage: substantially landed
- project-wide visibility stage: just landed on `2026-03-30`

The current posture is no longer "build many new raw features as fast as possible".
It has shifted to:

- keep domain contracts stable
- keep docs/help/output aligned with real behavior
- reopen a domain only if a real user or consumer proves a missing decision-critical signal
- treat `overview` and `project-status` as thin consumers, not new giant feature owners

## 9. Practical Conclusion

What this project has achieved across the reviewed history is substantial:

- it established a real product shape around `grafana-util`
- it moved the maintained operator surface to Rust
- it built meaningful workflows for dashboard, datasource, alert, access, and sync
- it differentiated itself with review-first, dry-run, preflight, governance, and audit-oriented flows
- it recently added project-level overview/status so work can be understood above individual commands

The strongest message for an external reviewer is this:

- this was not shallow feature accumulation
- the history shows repeated work on workflow safety, typed outputs, architectural boundaries, org-aware replay, and operator review surfaces
- the project now reflects intentional system design, not just incremental command growth

If this were presented as a company-style weekly progress review, the clearest framing would be:

- Week 1: establish the product and unify the command model
- Week 2: make contracts, review surfaces, and operator workflows trustworthy
- Week 3: deepen Rust analysis, TUI, browse, promotion, and review-first workflows
- Week 4: add whole-project visibility and shift into stabilization mode
