# Grafana Documentation

Use this site as a mixed entry point. Start with the handbook when you want the reading path, or open the command reference when you already know the command family. The landing page keeps both cores visible so you can move from task, to chapter, to exact syntax without hunting.

- [Start with the handbook](../user-guide/en/index.md)
- [Open command reference](../commands/en/index.md)

## First Run

If this is a new machine or a new Grafana environment, follow this order:

### Confirm the binary

Start by checking `grafana-util --version` so you know the CLI is installed and on your path.

- [Getting Started](../user-guide/en/getting-started.md)
- [Command Reference](../commands/en/version.md)

### Run the first read-only check

Use `grafana-util status live` as the first live read against Grafana before attempting any broader workflow.

- [Getting Started](../user-guide/en/getting-started.md)
- [Status Command Reference](../commands/en/status.md)

### Save a reusable connection profile

After the first successful read, store host and credentials with `grafana-util config profile add ...`.

- [New User Path](../user-guide/en/role-new-user.md)
- [Profile Command Reference](../commands/en/profile.md)

## Read By Role

Choose the reading path that best matches who is operating Grafana today.

### New user

Use the shortest safe path when this is your first time with the CLI or your first Grafana connection.

- [New User Path](../user-guide/en/role-new-user.md)
- [Getting Started](../user-guide/en/getting-started.md)

### SRE / operator

Start from day-two operations, workspace review, and pre-change inspection rather than the syntax index.

- [SRE / Ops Path](../user-guide/en/role-sre-ops.md)
- [Workspace Review & Status](../user-guide/en/status-workspace.md)

### Automation / CI

Go here when the CLI will run inside pipelines, release automation, or repeatable validation flows.

- [Automation / CI Path](../user-guide/en/role-automation-ci.md)
- [Technical Reference](../user-guide/en/reference.md)

### Maintainer / architect

This route is for repository structure, design rules, and implementation-facing contracts.

- [Architecture & Design Principles](../user-guide/en/architecture.md)
- [Developer guide](../DEVELOPER.md)

## Read By Task

Start from the thing you are trying to get done, then move into the matching chapter set.

### Understand what the tool is for

Read this before choosing a workflow if you still need the mental model for what the CLI is trying to protect and automate.

- [What grafana-util is for](../user-guide/en/what-is-grafana-util.md)

### Check live or staged state

Use this path for read-only inspection, staged review, or pre-change status checks.

- [Workspace Review & Status](../user-guide/en/status-workspace.md)
- [Status Command Reference](../commands/en/status.md)

### Work on dashboards

This path covers browse, export, analysis, review, patch, publish, and capture flows around dashboards.

- [Dashboard Management](../user-guide/en/dashboard.md)
- [Dashboard Command Reference](../commands/en/dashboard.md)

### Work on data sources or alerts

Use this when you are changing Grafana integrations, alert rules, contact points, or governance checks.

- [Data source Management](../user-guide/en/datasource.md)
- [Alerting Governance](../user-guide/en/alert.md)

### Manage access and credentials

Start here for orgs, teams, service accounts, tokens, and access-oriented operational changes.

- [Access Management](../user-guide/en/access.md)
- [Access Command Reference](../commands/en/access.md)

## Browse By Command Family

Use this when you already know the root command family and want the shortest route into syntax and workflow context.

### `status` and `workspace`

These roots cover inspection, staging review, and workspace-oriented validation paths.

- [Status / Workspace chapters](../user-guide/en/status-workspace.md)
- [Workspace Command Reference](../commands/en/workspace.md)

### `config profile`

Use this to manage reusable connection defaults and secret storage for later commands.

- [Getting Started](../user-guide/en/getting-started.md)
- [Profile Command Reference](../commands/en/profile.md)

### `dashboard`

This root owns browse, summary, variables, export, diff, patch, publish, and screenshot workflows.

- [Dashboard chapters](../user-guide/en/dashboard.md)
- [Dashboard Command Reference](../commands/en/dashboard.md)

### `datasource`, `alert`, and `access`

These roots cover change workflows for integrations, alerting, and Grafana identity surfaces.

- [Datasource Command Reference](../commands/en/datasource.md)
- [Alert Command Reference](../commands/en/alert.md)
- [Access Command Reference](../commands/en/access.md)

## Complete Reference

When you need full coverage rather than a curated starting path, use the complete source surfaces here.

### Read the full handbook

Use the handbook when you want chapters, operating context, and recommended reading order.

- [Operator Handbook](../user-guide/en/index.md)

### Read the full command reference

Use the command reference when you need per-command pages, subcommand routing, and stable syntax lookup.

- [Command Reference](../commands/en/index.md)
- [grafana-util(1)](../html/man/grafana-util.html)

### Check source and releases

Use the repository when you need change history, release notes, or issue tracking rather than operator docs.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kenduest-brobridge/grafana-util)
- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/kenduest-brobridge/grafana-util/releases)
- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/kenduest-brobridge/grafana-util/issues)

## Maintainer

Maintainer guidance stays in the repository docs rather than the public handbook.

- [Developer guide](../DEVELOPER.md)
