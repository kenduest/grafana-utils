# Changelog

This file is the fixed release-note source for `grafana-utils`.

It is intended to stay operator-facing:

- summarize user-visible changes by tagged release
- call out important migration notes
- avoid low-level internal refactor detail unless it changes behavior

Format rule going forward:

- add the next release at the top
- keep older tagged releases below
- use commit/tag history as the source of truth

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-03

### Highlights

- The published HTML docs site is now enabled on GitHub Pages for the
  `kenduest-brobridge/grafana-utils` repository and linked from the README.
- The README landing pages were rewritten in a more professional,
  operator-facing tone for SRE, sysadmin, and platform-maintainer audiences.
- The Traditional Chinese README wording was refined toward Taiwan usage rather
  than literal machine-style translation.

### Added

- GitHub Pages enablement in the docs deployment workflow so the docs site can
  self-bootstrap on repositories that have not enabled Pages yet.

### Changed

- README and README.zh-TW now point to the correct published docs URL:
  - `https://kenduest-brobridge.github.io/grafana-utils/`
- The English README now presents the tool as an operational and
  administration CLI rather than as a marketing-style landing page.
- The Traditional Chinese README now uses more natural Taiwan-oriented wording
  across the landing sections, workflow headings, and documentation routing.

### Fixed

- The previous published docs URL in the README pointed at an old
  `kendlee.github.io` address and did not resolve for the current repository.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-03

### Highlights

- Dashboard migration now includes a dedicated `raw-to-prompt` workflow for
  converting ordinary Grafana dashboard JSON into UI-importable prompt JSON.
- The operator documentation now has a generated reference surface alongside
  the handbook, including man pages, local HTML output, and a clearer
  maintainer-oriented docs map.
- Live connection profiles now support multiple secret-storage modes, so
  repeated URL and credential handling can move out of ad hoc command lines.

### Added

- New dashboard migration command:
  - `grafana-util dashboard raw-to-prompt`
- New profile secret-storage modes in the Rust implementation:
  - `file`
  - `os`
  - `encrypted-file`
- New generated documentation surfaces:
  - `docs/man/*.1`
  - `docs/html/`
  - `make man`
  - `make man-check`
  - `make html`
  - `make html-check`
- New maintainer/internal docs for generated-doc architecture, playbooks,
  maintainer quickstart, role maps, and profile secret-storage design.
- New browser-enabled Rust build lane for release artifacts that need the
  optional browser feature.

### Changed

- `raw-to-prompt` now preserves the historical prompt semantics used by the
  existing exported dashboard bundles, including datasource-variable and
  prompt-placeholder edge cases.
- The operator handbook, command reference, generated HTML, and man pages are
  now aligned around the same command-doc source layer instead of drifting as
  separate handwritten outputs.
- Auth and example guidance now prefer `--profile` and basic-auth/profile
  workflows before token-first examples, with clearer notes around multi-org
  and scope limitations.
- Maintainer entry docs now route more explicitly by task and role, including
  first-entry guidance for new maintainers and AI/code agents.

### Fixed

- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` is clean again after addressing
  the profile CLI enum layout and secret-store lint issues.
- Dashboard prompt migration now matches the checked historical prompt bundle
  semantics used for compatibility validation, rather than producing only a
  superficially similar prompt document.

### Migration Notes

- If you receive a plain Grafana dashboard export and need a UI-importable
  prompt file, use `grafana-util dashboard raw-to-prompt` instead of trying to
  feed that JSON directly into the staged replay/import workflow.
- If you maintain local docs or release docs, treat `docs/commands/*` and
  `docs/user-guide/*` as the editable source layers; `docs/man/*.1` and
  `docs/html/` are generated artifacts.
- If you rely on repeated live connection flags, prefer moving them into
  profiles before the `0.7.0` line lands more broadly in release workflows.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-02

### Highlights

- The user guide now works as a bilingual handbook instead of a mixed set of
  oversized files and partial entry pages.
- The Traditional Chinese guide now follows the same chapter-based structure
  as the English handbook, so operators can move between languages without
  losing the reading order, workflow boundaries, or chapter layout.

### Changed

- `docs/user-guide/zh-TW/` is now the primary Traditional Chinese user-guide
  location.
- The English handbook chapters were expanded with per-page navigation,
  clearer table-based summaries, and more explicit output and interactive-mode
  guidance.
- The Traditional Chinese handbook now includes matching chapters for getting
  started, reference, dashboards, datasources, alerts, access, project-wide
  status, and scenarios.
- `docs/user-guide-TW.md` now remains as a compatibility bridge for older
  links while directing readers into the new handbook structure.
- `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPER.md` now point to the
  maintained handbook paths.

### Notes

- This release remains documentation-focused. It improves how operators find,
  read, and follow the maintained workflows; it does not change the CLI's live
  Grafana behavior.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-02

### Highlights

- The English operator guide moved from one oversized file into a handbook
  layout with focused chapters for getting started, reference, dashboards,
  datasources, alerts, access, project-wide status, and task-oriented
  scenarios.
- Release-facing entry docs now point readers directly at the handbook, so
  the first-run path is clearer and the older single-file guide no longer has
  to carry the full operator manual by itself.

### Changed

- `docs/user-guide/en/` is now the primary English user-guide location.
- `docs/user-guide.md` now remains as a compatibility bridge for older links
  while directing readers into the handbook structure.
- The English handbook now includes validated live-output excerpts for version
  checks, project status, dashboard inventory, and datasource inventory.

### Notes

- This release is documentation-focused. It does not change the Grafana API
  behavior of the CLI; it changes how the operator manual is organized and how
  readers discover the maintained workflows.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-02

### Highlights

- The CLI now exposes a direct version check at the root through both
  `grafana-util --version` and `grafana-util version`.
- The release-facing documentation was rewritten to make the command areas,
  workflow boundaries, and staged contract rules easier to follow.

### Changed

- `README.md` and `README.zh-TW.md` now act more like product entry pages:
  they explain what the tool is for, how the major command areas fit
  together, and which staged workflow rules matter most.
- `docs/user-guide.md` and `docs/user-guide-TW.md` now tell operators to
  confirm the installed CLI version at the start of the workflow.

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions release and quality workflows now use Node 24 compatible
  versions of the official checkout, setup-python, upload-artifact, and
  download-artifact actions, avoiding the Node 20 deprecation warnings on
  current runners.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-02

### Highlights

- The Rust CLI grew from resource-specific commands into a more complete
  operator surface with `overview`, `status`, `change`, `snapshot`, and
  `profile` workflows.
- Dashboard and datasource staged contracts are now more explicit, especially
  around provisioning lanes, export roots, and replay/import boundaries.
- Alert management now supports a fuller desired-state authoring and
  review/apply workflow instead of only export/import style flows.

### Added

- New top-level project surfaces:
  - `grafana-util overview`
  - `grafana-util status`
  - `grafana-util change`
- New top-level snapshot workflow:
  - `grafana-util snapshot export`
  - `grafana-util snapshot review`
- New profile workflow for repo-local live connection defaults:
  - `grafana-util profile init`
  - `grafana-util profile list`
  - `grafana-util profile show`
- New dashboard authoring helpers:
  - `dashboard get`
  - `dashboard clone-live`
  - `dashboard patch-file`
  - `dashboard review`
  - `dashboard publish`
- New dashboard browser and delete workflows.
- New dashboard provisioning lane support across export/import/diff/validate,
  and inspect flows.
- New datasource provisioning lane support across export/import/diff and
  inspect flows.
- New datasource masked-recovery contract with placeholder-based secret
  recovery support.
- New alert desired-state management surfaces:
  - `alert init`
  - `alert add-rule`
  - `alert clone-rule`
  - `alert add-contact-point`
  - `alert set-route`
  - `alert preview-route`
  - `alert plan`
  - `alert apply`
  - `alert delete`
- Repo-owned install script for release binaries:
  - `scripts/install.sh`

### Changed

- Public project vocabulary is now centered on:
  - `overview` for human-first project entry
  - `status` for staged/live readiness
  - `change` for staged review/apply workflows
- The older `sync` and `project-status` names are now treated as internal
  runtime/architecture names rather than the preferred public surface.
- Dashboard staged exports are more explicit:
  - `raw/` is the canonical dashboard replay/export variant
  - `provisioning/` is a separate provisioning-oriented variant
- Datasource staged exports are more explicit:
  - `datasources.json` remains the canonical replay/import/diff contract
  - `provisioning/datasources.yaml` is a projection for Grafana provisioning,
    not the primary restore contract
- `overview` and `status` now consume domain-owned staged contracts more
  consistently instead of reinterpreting staged layouts ad hoc.
- Shared output handling is more consistent across commands, including broader
  text/table/csv/json/yaml coverage and color-aware JSON rendering.
- Live dashboard and datasource status reporting is more consistent with the
  staged contract boundaries, especially around multi-org and root-scoped
  inventory reads.

### Fixed

- Alert authoring round-trip behavior is more stable after apply by normalizing
  equivalent live payload shapes more conservatively.
- Datasource secret handling is more explicit and fail-closed when required
  recovery values are missing.
- Access and alert list/browse/runtime presentation now align better with the
  shared output and interactive shell behavior.
- Snapshot review wording and inventory behavior are clearer and more aligned
  with the actual staged review flow.

### Migration Notes

- If you were using older project-level naming, prefer:
  - `grafana-util change ...` instead of older `sync`-style public wording
  - `grafana-util status ...` instead of older `project-status` public wording
- For dashboard staged inputs, treat `raw/` and `provisioning/` as separate
  contracts rather than interchangeable path aliases.
- For datasource staged inputs, treat `datasources.json` as the canonical
  replay/import artifact and use provisioning YAML only for provisioning-style
  consumption.
- For live command defaults, `grafana-util.yaml` plus `--profile` is now the
  preferred path over repeating the same URL/auth/TLS flags in every command.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-27
